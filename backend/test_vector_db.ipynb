As far as your eyes can see, there are numbers, numbers and\\nnumbers!\\nFig. 1.2\\nNow suppose you start walking along the number line, and collecting some of the\\nnumbers. Get a bag ready to store them!\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c2\\nMATHEMATICS\\nN\\n1\\n16\\n5\\n58\\n0\\n31\\n4652\\n71 10\\n2\\n9\\n40\\n601\\n74\\nYou might begin with picking up only natural\\nnumbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. You know that this list\\ngoes on for ever. (Why is this true?) So, now your\\nbag contains infinitely many natural numbers! Recall\\nthat we denote this collection by the symbol N.\\nNow turn and walk all the way back, pick up\\nzero and put it into the bag. You now have the\\ncollection of whole numbers which is denoted by\\nthe symbol W.\\n0\\nW\\n3\\n40\\n5\\n2\\n16\\n74\\n29\\n601\\n58\\nNow, stretching in front of you are many, many negative integers. Put all the\\nnegative integers into your bag. What is your new collection? Recall that it is the\\ncollection of all integers, and it is denoted by the symbol Z.\\n-40\\nZ comes from the\\n-757\\nWhy Z ?\\n-66\\n-21\\nGerman word\\n-3\\n“zahlen”, which means\\n71\\n16\\n5\\n58\\n0\\n3\\nZ\\n“to count”.\\n31\\n0\\n2\\n422\\n3\\n166\\n601\\n-40\\n40\\n-75\\n2\\n74\\n9\\n1\\n22\\nAre there some numbers still left on the line? Of course! There are numbers like\\n1 3\\n,\\n, or even 2005\\n−\\n. If you put all such numbers also into the bag, it will now be the\\n2 4\\n2006\\n–\\n17\\n981\\n2005\\n2006\\n–12\\n13\\n19\\nQ\\n9\\n14\\n–6625\\n0\\n–6\\n7\\n3\\n27\\n–6\\n7\\n19\\n71\\n58\\n58\\n9\\n14\\n16\\n2005\\n2006\\n-65\\n999\\n–12\\n13\\n999\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n89\\n60\\n81\\n16\\n4\\n–6721\\n12\\n–6625\\n27\\n–5\\n1\\n4\\n–1\\n9\\n–8\\n60\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cNUMBER SYSTEMS\\n3\\ncollection of rational numbers. The collection of rational numbers is denoted by Q.\\n‘Rational’ comes from the word ‘ratio’, and Q comes from the word ‘quotient’.\\nYou may recall the definition of rational numbers:\\nA number ‘r’ is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p\\nq ,\\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. (Why do we insist that q ≠ 0?)\\nNotice that all the numbers now in the bag can be written in the form p\\nq , where p\\n−\\n here p = –25\\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, –25 can be written as \\n25;\\n1\\nand q = 1. Therefore, the rational numbers also include the natural numbers, whole\\nnumbers and integers.\\nYou also know that the rational numbers do not have a unique representation in\\nthe form p\\nq , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. For example, 1\\n2  = 2\\n4  = 10\\n20  = 25\\n50\\n= 47\\n94 , and so on. These are equivalent rational numbers (or fractions). However,\\nwhen we say that p\\nq  is a rational number, or when we represent p\\nq  on the number\\nline, we assume that q ≠ 0 and that  p and q have no common factors other than 1\\n(that is, p and q are co-prime). So, on the number line, among the infinitely many\\nfractions equivalent to 1\\n2 , we will choose 1\\n2  to represent all of them.\\nNow, let us solve some examples about the different types of numbers, which you\\nhave studied in earlier classes.\\nExample 1 : Are the following statements true or false? Give reasons for your answers.\\n(i)\\nEvery whole number is a natural number.\\n(ii) Every integer is a rational number.\\n(iii) Every rational number is an integer.\\nSolution : (i) False, because zero is a whole number but not a natural number.\\n(ii) True, because every integer m can be expressed in the form 1\\nm , and so it is a\\nrational number.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c4\\nMATHEMATICS\\n(iii) False, because 3\\n5  is not an integer.\\nExample 2 : Find five rational numbers between 1 and 2.\\nWe can approach this problem in at least two ways.\\nSolution 1 : Recall that to find a rational number between r and s, you can add r and\\nr\\ns\\n+\\n lies between r and s. So, 3\\ns and divide the sum by 2, that is \\n2\\n2  is a number\\nbetween 1 and 2. You can proceed in this manner to find four more rational numbers\\nbetween 1 and 2. These four numbers are 5 11 13\\n7.\\n,\\n,\\nand\\n4\\n8\\n8\\n4\\nSolution 2 : The other option is to find all the five rational numbers in one step. Since\\nwe want five numbers, we write 1 and 2 as rational numbers with denominator 5 + 1,\\ni.e., 1 = 6\\n6  and 2 = 12\\n6 . Then you can check that 7\\n6 , 8\\n6 , 9\\n6 , 10\\n6  and 11\\n6  are all rational\\nnumbers between 1 and 2. So, the five numbers are 7 4 3 5\\n11\\n,\\n,\\n,\\nand\\n6 3 2 3\\n6 .\\nRemark : Notice that in Example 2, you were asked to find five rational numbers\\nbetween 1 and 2. But, you must have realised that in fact there are infinitely many\\nrational numbers between 1 and 2. In general, there are infinitely many rational\\nnumbers between any two given rational numbers.\\nLet us take a look at the number line again. Have you picked up all the numbers?\\nNot, yet. The fact is that there are infinitely many more numbers left on the number\\nline! There are gaps in between the places of the numbers you picked up, and not just',\n",

The amazing thing is that there are infinitely many\\nnumbers lying between any two of these gaps too!\\nSo we are left with the following questions:\\n1. What are the numbers, that are left on the number\\nline, called?\\n2. How do we recognise them? That is, how do we\\ndistinguish them from the rationals (rational\\nnumbers)?\\nThese questions will be answered in the next section.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cNUMBER SYSTEMS\\n5\\nEXERCISE 1.1\\n1.\\nIs zero a rational number?

In this section, we are going to investigate these numbers. So far, all\\nthe numbers you have come across, are of the form p\\nq , where p and q are integers\\nand q ≠ 0. So, you may ask: are there numbers which are not of this form? There are\\nindeed such numbers.\\nThe Pythagoreans in Greece, followers of the famous\\nmathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, were the first\\nto discover the numbers which were not rationals, around\\n400 BC. These numbers are called irrational numbers\\n(irrationals), because they cannot be written in the form of\\na ratio of integers. There are many myths surrounding the\\ndiscovery of irrational numbers by the Pythagorean,\\nHippacus of Croton. In all the myths, Hippacus has an\\nunfortunate end, either for discovering that \\n2  is irrational\\nPythagoras\\n(569 BCE – 479 BCE)\\nor for disclosing the secret about \\n2  to people outside the\\nsecret Pythagorean sect!\\nFig. 1.3\\n Let us formally define these numbers.\\nA number ‘s’ is called irrational, if it cannot be written in the form p\\nq , where p\\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c6\\nMATHEMATICS\\nYou already know that there are infinitely many rationals. It turns out that there\\nare infinitely many irrational numbers too. Some examples are:\\n2,\\n3,\\n15,, π, 0.10110111011110...\\nRemark : Recall that when we use the symbol \\n, we assume that it is the\\npositive square root of the number. So \\n4  = 2, though both 2 and –2 are square\\nroots of 4.\\nSome of the irrational numbers listed above are familiar to you. For example, you\\nhave already come across many of the square roots listed above and the number π.\\nThe Pythagoreans proved that \\n2  is irrational. Later in approximately 425 BC,\\nTheodorus of Cyrene showed that 3,\\n5,\\n6,\\n7,\\n10,\\n11,\\n12,\\n13, 14,\\n15\\nand 17  are also irrationals. Proofs of irrationality of \\n2 , \\n3 , \\n5 , etc., shall be\\ndiscussed in Class X.  As to π, it was known to various cultures for thousands of\\nyears, it was proved to be irrational by Lambert and Legendre only in the late 1700s.\\nIn the next section, we will discuss why 0.10110111011110... and π are irrational.\\nR\\n17\\n981\\n9\\n14\\n3\\n71\\n58\\n36\\n2005\\n2006\\n0\\n16\\n–12\\n13\\n-65\\n999\\n0\\n2\\n3\\n89\\n4\\n–66\\n26\\n19\\n–6625\\n27\\n–5\\n60\\n-45\\n–8\\n–6\\n7\\nLet us return to the questions raised at the end of\\nthe previous section. Remember the bag of rational\\nnumbers. If we now put all irrational numbers into\\nthe bag, will there be any number left on the number\\nline? The answer is no! It turns out that the collection\\nof all rational numbers and irrational numbers together\\nmake up what we call the collection of real numbers,\\nwhich is denoted by R. Therefore, a real number is either rational or irrational. So, we\\ncan say that every real number is represented by a unique point on the number\\nline. Also, every point on the number line represents a unique real number.\\nThis is why we call the number line, the real number line.\\nIn the 1870s two German mathematicians,\\nCantor and Dedekind, showed that :\\nCorresponding to every real number, there is a\\npoint on the real number line, and corresponding\\nto every point on the number line, there exists a\\nunique real number.\\nG.

Now draw a line\\nsegment P2P3 perpendicular to OP2. Then draw a line\\nsegment P3P4 perpendicular to OP3.

We will look at the decimal expansions of real numbers and see if we\\ncan use the expansions to distinguish between rationals and irrationals. We will also\\nexplain how to visualise the representation of real numbers on the number line using\\ntheir decimal expansions. Since rationals are more familiar to us, let us start with\\nthem. Let us take three examples : \\n10\\n7\\n1\\n,\\n,\\n3\\n8\\n7 .\\nPay special attention to the remainders and see if you can find any pattern.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cNUMBER SYSTEMS\\n9\\nExample 5 : Find the decimal expansions of 10\\n3 , 7\\n8  and 1\\n7 .\\nSolution :\\n    3.333...\\n    0.875\\n      0.142857...\\n3 10\\n8 7.0\\n7\\n1.0\\n     9\\n    64\\n        7\\n     10\\n      60\\n        30\\n      9\\n      56\\n        28\\n     10\\n        40\\n          20\\n       9\\n        40\\n          14\\n       10\\n         0\\n            60\\n         9\\n            56\\n         1\\n             40\\n             35\\n               50\\n               49\\n       1\\nRemainders : 1, 1, 1, 1, 1...\\nRemainders : 6, 4, 0\\nRemainders : 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1,\\nDivisor : 3\\nDivisor : 8\\n3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1,...\\nDivisor : 7\\nWhat have you noticed? You should have noticed at least three things:\\n(i)\\nThe remainders either become 0 after a certain stage, or start repeating themselves.\\n(ii)\\nThe number of entries in the repeating string of remainders is less than the divisor\\n(in 10\\n3  one number repeats itself and the divisor is 3, in 1\\n7  there are six entries\\n326451 in the repeating string of remainders and 7 is the divisor).\\n(iii) If the remainders repeat, then we get a repeating block of digits in the quotient\\n(for 10\\n3 , 3 repeats in the quotient and for 1\\n7 , we get the repeating block 142857\\nin the quotient).\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c10\\nMATHEMATICS\\nAlthough we have noticed this pattern using only the examples above, it is true for all\\nrationals of the form p\\nq  (q ≠ 0). On division of p by q, two main things happen – either\\nthe remainder becomes zero or never becomes zero and we get a repeating string of\\nremainders. Let us look at each case separately.\\nCase (i) : The remainder becomes zero\\nIn the example of 7\\n8 , we found that the remainder becomes zero after some steps and\\nthe decimal expansion of 7\\n8  = 0.875. Other examples are 1\\n2  = 0.5, 639\\n250  = 2.556. In all\\nthese cases, the decimal expansion terminates or ends after a finite number of steps.',\n",

In other words, we have a\\nrepeating block of digits in the quotient. We say that this expansion is non-terminating\\nrecurring. For example, 10\\n3  = 3.3333... and 1\\n7  = 0.142857142857142857...\\nThe usual way of showing that 3 repeats in the quotient of 10\\n3  is to write it as 3.3.\\nSimilarly, since the block of digits 142857 repeats in the quotient of 1\\n7 , we write 1\\n7  as\\n0.142857 , where the bar above the digits indicates the block of digits that repeats.\\nAlso 3.57272... can be written as 3.572 . So, all these examples give us non-terminating\\nrecurring (repeating) decimal expansions.\\nThus, we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers have only two choices:\\neither they are terminating or non-terminating recurring.\\nNow suppose, on the other hand, on your walk on the number line, you come across a\\nnumber like 3.142678 whose decimal expansion is terminating or a number like\\n1.272727... that is, 1.27 , whose decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring, can\\nyou conclude that it is a rational number?

In other words, express 3.142678\\nin the form p\\nq , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\\nSolution : We have 3.142678 = 3142678\\n, and hence is a rational number.\\n1000000\\nNow, let us consider the case when the decimal expansion is non-terminating recurring.\\nExample 7 : Show that 0.3333... = 03.  can be expressed in the form p\\nq , where p and\\nq are integers and q ≠ 0.\\nSolution : Since we do not know what 03.  is , let us call it ‘x’ and so\\nx = 0.3333...\\nNow here is where the trick comes in. Look at\\n10 x = 10 × (0.333...) = 3.333...\\nNow,\\n3.3333... = 3 + x, since x = 0.3333...\\nTherefore,\\n10 x = 3 + x\\nSolving for x, we get\\n9x = 3, i.e., x = 1\\n3\\nExample 8 : Show that 1.272727... = 1 27\\n.\\n can be expressed in the form p\\nq , where p\\nand q are integers and q ≠ 0.\\nSolution : Let x = 1.272727... Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to\\nget\\n100 x = 127.2727...\\nSo,\\n100 x = 126 + 1.272727... = 126 + x\\nTherefore,\\n100 x – x = 126, i.e., 99 x = 126\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c12\\nMATHEMATICS\\ni.e.,\\nx = 126\\n14\\n99\\n11\\n=\\nYou can check the reverse that 14\\n11  = 1 27\\n.\\n.\\nExample 9 : Show that 0.2353535... = 0 235\\n.\\n can be expressed in the form p\\nq ,\\nwhere p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.\\nSolution : Let x = 0 235\\n.\\n. Over here, note that 2 does not repeat, but the block 35\\nrepeats. Since two digits are repeating, we multiply x by 100 to get\\n100 x = 23.53535...\\nSo,\\n100 x = 23.3 + 0.23535... = 23.3 + x\\nTherefore,\\n99 x = 23.3\\n, which gives x = 233\\ni.e.,\\n99 x = 233\\n10\\n990\\nYou can also check the reverse that 233\\n990  = 0 235\\n.\\n.\\nSo, every number with a non-terminating recurring decimal expansion can be expressed\\nin the form p\\nq  (q ≠ 0), where p and q are integers. Let us summarise our results in the\\nfollowing form :\\nThe decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-\\nterminating recurring.

The same\\ndefinition can be extended for positive real numbers.\\nLet a > 0 be a real number. Then \\na  = b means b2 = a and b > 0.\\nIn Section 1.2, we saw how to represent n  for any positive integer n on the number\\nline. We now show how to find \\nx  for any given positive real number x geometrically.\\nFor example, let us find it for x = 3.5, i.e., we find 3 5.  geometrically.\\nFig. 1.11\\nMark the distance 3.5 units from a fixed point A on a given line to obtain a point B such\\nthat AB = 3.5 units (see Fig. 1.11). From B, mark a distance of 1 unit and mark the\\nnew point as C. Find the mid-point of AC and mark that point as O. Draw a semicircle\\nwith centre O and radius OC. Draw a line perpendicular to AC passing through B and\\nintersecting the semicircle at D. Then, BD = 3.5 .\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cNUMBER SYSTEMS\\n17\\nMore generally, to find \\nx , for any positive real\\nnumber x, we mark B so that AB = x units, and, as in\\nFig. 1.12, mark C so that BC = 1 unit. Then, as we\\nhave done for the case x = 3.5, we find BD = \\nx\\n(see Fig. 1.12). We can prove this result using the\\nPythagoras Theorem.\\nFig. 1.12\\nNotice that, in Fig. 1.12, ∆ OBD is a right-angled triangle. Also, the radius of the circle\\nis \\n1\\nx +\\n units.\\n2\\nx +\\n units.\\nTherefore, OC = OD = OA = \\n1\\n2\\n1\\n1\\nNow, OB = \\n2\\n2\\nx\\nx\\nx\\n+\\n−\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8f6\\n−\\n=\\n⋅\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\uf8f8\\nSo, by the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\\nBD2 = OD2 – OB2 = \\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n4\\n2\\n2\\n4\\nx\\nx\\nx\\nx\\n+\\n−\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8f6\\n−\\n=\\n=\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\uf8f8\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\uf8f8\\n.\\nThis shows that BD = \\nx .\\nThis construction gives us a visual, and geometric way of showing that \\nx  exists for\\nall real numbers x > 0. If you want to know the position of \\nx  on the number line,\\nthen let us treat the line BC as the number line, with B as zero, C as 1, and so on.\\nDraw an arc with centre B and radius BD, which intersects the number line in E\\n(see Fig. 1.13).

       " 'POLYNOMIALS\\n25\\nCHAPTER 2\\nPOLYNOMIALS\\n2.1 Introduction\\nYou have studied algebraic expressions, their addition, subtraction, multiplication and\\ndivision in earlier classes. You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic\\nexpressions. You may recall the algebraic identities :\\n(x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2\\n(x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2\\nand\\nx2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y)\\nand their use in factorisation. In this chapter, we shall start our study with a particular\\ntype of algebraic expression, called polynomial, and the terminology related to it. We\\nshall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the\\nfactorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic\\nidentities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.\\n2.2 Polynomials in One Variable\\nLet us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real\\nvalue. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2x, 3x, – x, – 1\\n2 x\\nare algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now\\nsuppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do\\nnot know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So\\nthe expression will be ax, say.\\nHowever, there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter\\ndenoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular\\nsituation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the\\nvalue of a variable can keep changing.\\n2024-25\\n\\x0c26\\nMATHEMATICS\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\nFig. 2.1\\nNow, consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.1).\\nWhat is its perimeter? You know that the perimeter of a square\\nis the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is\\n3 units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the\\nperimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter\\nis 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x\\nunits (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4x units. So, as\\nthe length of the side varies, the perimeter varies.\\nx\\nS\\nR\\nx\\nx\\nP\\nQ\\nx\\nFig. 2.2\\nCan you find the area of the square PQRS? It is\\nx × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are\\nalso familiar with other algebraic expressions like\\n2x, x2 + 2x, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic\\nexpressions we have considered so far have only whole\\nnumbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this\\nform are called polynomials in one variable. In the examples\\nabove, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a\\npolynomial in x. Similarly, 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the\\nvariable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t.\\nIn the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2x are called the terms of the\\npolynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely, 3y2, 5y and\\n7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has\\n4 terms, namely, –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2.\\nEach term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the\\ncoefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the\\ncoefficient of x0 (Remember, x0 = 1). Do you know the coefficient of x in x2 – x + 7?\\nIt is –1.\\n2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials.\\nThe constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important\\nrole in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes.\\nNow, consider algebraic expressions such as x + \\n2\\n3\\n1 ,\\n3 and\\n.\\n+\\n+\\nx\\ny\\ny\\nx\\n Do you\\nknow that you can write x + 1\\nx  = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e.,\\nx–1 is –1, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\nx\\n+\\n. Here the exponent of x is 1\\nAgain, \\n3\\nx +\\n can be written as \\n2 , which is\\nnot a whole number. So, is \\n3\\nx +\\n a polynomial? No, it is not. What about\\n3 y  + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).\\n2024-25\\n\\x0cPOLYNOMIALS\\n27\\nIf the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or q(x),\\nor r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write :\\np(x) = 2x2 + 5x – 3\\nq(x) = x3 –1\\nr(y) = y3 + y + 1\\ns(u) = 2 – u – u2 + 6u5\\nA polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x150 + x149 + ...\\n+ x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms.\\nConsider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these\\npolynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials\\n(‘mono’ means ‘one’).\\nNow observe each of the following polynomials:\\np(x) = x + 1,\\nq(x) = x2 – x,\\nr(y) = y9 + 1,\\nt(u) = u15 – u2\\nHow many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only\\ntwo terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’).\\nSimilarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials\\n(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are\\np(x) = x + x2 + π,\\nq(x) =',\n",
       " '(‘mono’ means ‘one’).\\nNow observe each of the following polynomials:\\np(x) = x + 1,\\nq(x) = x2 – x,\\nr(y) = y9 + 1,\\nt(u) = u15 – u2\\nHow many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only\\ntwo terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’).\\nSimilarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials\\n(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are\\np(x) = x + x2 + π,\\nq(x) =\\n2  + x – x2,\\nr(u) = u + u2 – 2,\\nt(y) = y4 + y + 5.\\nNow, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the\\nhighest power of x ? It is 3x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the\\npolynomial q(y) = 5y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the\\nexponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial\\nas the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9\\nis 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero\\nconstant polynomial is zero.\\nExample 1 : Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below:\\n(i) x5 – x4 + 3\\n(ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8\\n(iii) 2\\nSolution : (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial\\nis 5.\\n(ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8.\\n(iii) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x0. So the exponent of x is 0.\\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0.\\n2024-25\\n\\x0c28\\nMATHEMATICS\\nNow observe the polynomials p(x) = 4x + 5, q(y) = 2y, r(t) = t + \\n2 and\\ns(u) = 3 – u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of\\nthese polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial.\\nSome more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x – 1, 2 y + 1, 2 – u. Now, try and\\nfind a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a\\nlinear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will\\nbe of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a ≠ 0 (why?). Similarly,\\nay + b is a linear polynomial in y.\\nNow consider the polynomials :\\n2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x + π, x2 and x2 + 2\\n5 x\\nDo you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called\\na quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2,\\n4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four\\ndifferent terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at\\nmost 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any\\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are\\nconstants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided\\na ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants.\\nWe call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a\\ncubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x3 + 1, 5x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How\\nmany terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at\\nmost 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 and\\na, b, c and d are constants.\\nNow, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3\\nlooks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural\\nnumber n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form\\n anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0\\nwhere a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an ≠ 0.\\nIn particular, if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get\\nthe zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial?\\nThe degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.\\nSo far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have\\npolynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables\\nare x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the\\nvariables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in\\nthree and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail\\nlater.\\n2024-25\\n\\x0cPOLYNOMIALS\\n29\\nEXERCISE 2.1\\n1.\\nWhich of the following expressions are polynomials in one variable and which are\\nnot?

Note that :  p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0.\\nAs p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x).\\nSimilarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2.\\nIn general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0.\\nYou must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by\\nequating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial\\nequation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero\\nof the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0.\\nNow, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no\\nzero because replacing x by any number in 5x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero\\nconstant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By\\nconvention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.\\nExample 3 : Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2.\\nSolution : Let p(x) = x + 2.\\nThen p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0\\nTherefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not.\\nExample 4 : Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + 1.\\nSolution : Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation\\np(x) = 0\\n2024-25\\n\\x0cPOLYNOMIALS\\n31\\nNow,\\n2x + 1 = 0 gives us x = \\n1\\n– 2\\nSo, \\n1\\n– 2  is a zero of the polynomial 2x + 1.\\nNow, if p(x) = ax + b, a ≠ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of\\np(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x),\\namounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0.\\nNow, p(x) = 0 means\\nax + b = 0, a ≠ 0\\nSo,\\nax = –b\\n.\\ni.e.,\\nx = – b\\na\\nSo, x = \\nb\\na\\n−\\n is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zero.\\nNow we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.\\nExample 5 : Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\\nSolution : Let\\np(x) = x2 – 2x\\nThen\\np(2) = 22 – 4 = 4 – 4 = 0\\nand\\np(0) = 0 – 0 = 0\\nHence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.\\nLet us now list our observations:\\n(i) A zero of a polynomial need not be 0.\\n(ii) 0 may be a zero of a polynomial.\\n(iii) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero.\\n(iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero.\\nEXERCISE 2.2\\n1.\\nFind the value of the polynomial 5x – 4x2 + 3 at\\n(i)\\nx = 0\\n(ii) x = –1\\n(iii) x = 2\\n2.\\nFind p(0), p(1) and p(2) for each of the following polynomials:\\n(i)\\np(y) = y2 – y + 1\\n(ii) p(t) = 2 + t + 2t2 – t3\\n(iii) p(x) = x3\\n(iv) p(x) = (x – 1) (x + 1)\\n2024-25\\n\\x0c32\\nMATHEMATICS\\n3.\\nVerify whether the following are zeroes of the polynomial, indicated against them.\\n5\\n(i)\\np(x) = 3x + 1, x = \\n1\\n– 3\\n(ii) p(x) = 5x – π, x = 4\\n(iii) p(x) = x2 – 1, x = 1, –1\\n(iv) p(x) = (x + 1) (x – 2), x = – 1, 2\\n(v) p(x) = x2, x = 0\\n(vi) p(x) = lx + m, x = – m\\nl\\n(vii) p(x) = 3x2 – 1, x = \\n1\\n2\\n,\\n−\\n(viii) p(x) = 2x + 1, x = 1\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n4.\\nFind the zero of the polynomial in each of the following cases:\\n(i)\\np(x) = x + 5\\n(ii) p(x) = x – 5\\n(iii) p(x) = 2x + 5\\n(iv) p(x) = 3x – 2\\n(v) p(x) = 3x\\n(vi) p(x) = ax, a ≠ 0\\n(vii) p(x) = cx + d, c ≠ 0, c, d are real numbers.\\n2.4 Factorisation of Polynomials\\nLet us now look at the situation of Example 10 above more closely.

In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor\\nTheorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2).\\nExample 7 : Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k.\\nSolution : As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0\\nNow,\\np(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k\\nSo,\\n4 + 3 – 4 + k = 0\\ni.e.,\\nk = –3\\nWe will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3.\\nYou are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like\\nx2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that\\nab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic\\npolynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a ≠ 0 and a, b, c are constants.\\nFactorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as\\nfollows:\\n2\\n3x\\nLet its factors be (px + q) and (rx + s). Then\\nx = 3x = first term of quotient\\nax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs\\nComparing the coefficients of x2, we get a = pr.\\nSimilarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr.\\nAnd, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs.\\nThis shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is\\n(ps)(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac.\\nTherefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two\\nnumbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13.\\nExample 8 : Factorise 6x2 + 17x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the\\nFactor Theorem.\\nSolution 1 : (By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that\\np + q = 17\\nand\\npq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors.\\nSo, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5\\nand 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17.\\n2024-25\\n\\x0c34\\nMATHEMATICS\\nSo, 6x2 + 17x + 5 = 6x2 + (2 + 15)x + 5\\n= 6x2 + 2x + 15x + 5\\n= 2x(3x + 1) + 5(3x + 1)\\n= (3x + 1) (2x + 5)\\nSolution 2 : (Using the Factor Theorem)\\n = 6 p(x), say.

However,\\nlet us consider another example.\\nExample 9 : Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem.\\nSolution : Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now, if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the\\nconstant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the\\nfactors of 6.\\nThe factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.\\nNow,\\np(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0\\nSo,\\ny – 2 is a factor of p(y).\\n2024-25\\n\\x0cPOLYNOMIALS\\n35\\nAlso,\\np(3) = 32 – (5 × 3) + 6 = 0\\nSo,\\ny – 3 is also a factor of y2 – 5y + 6.\\nTherefore,\\ny2 – 5y + 6 = (y – 2)(y – 3)\\nNote that y2 – 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term –5y.\\nNow, let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not\\nbe appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in\\nthe following example.\\nExample 10 : Factorise x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120.\\nSolution : Let\\np(x) = x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120\\nWe shall now look for all the factors of –120.

You also know how\\nto describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which\\nto find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one\\nline. For example, consider the following situations:\\nI. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running\\nin the East-West direction and streets with\\nnumbering from West to East. Also, on each\\nstreet, house numbers are marked. To look for\\na friend’s house here, is it enough to know only\\none reference point? For instance, if we only\\nknow that she lives on Street 2, will we be able\\nto find her house easily? Not as easily as when\\nwe know two pieces of information about it,\\nnamely, the number of the street on which it is\\nsituated, and the house number. If we want to\\nreach the house which is situated in the 2nd\\nFig. 3.1\\nstreet and has the number 5, first of all we\\nwould identify the 2nd street and then the house\\nnumbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the\\nlocation of the house. Similarly, P shows the\\nlocation of the house corresponding to Street\\nnumber 7 and House number 4.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c44\\nMATHEMATICS\\nII. Suppose you put a dot on a sheet of paper [Fig.3.2 (a)]. If we ask you to tell us\\nthe position of the dot on the paper, how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some\\nsuch manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of\\nthe paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of\\nthese statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is\\nnearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still\\ndoes not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot\\nis also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is!\\nFig. 3.2\\nFor this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two\\nfixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In\\nother words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot.\\nNow, perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’.\\nActivity 1 (Seating Plan) : Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all\\nthe desks together. Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name\\nof the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each\\nstudent in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations:\\n(i) the column in which she or he sits,\\n(ii) the row in which she or he sits.\\nIf you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by\\nthe shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the\\ncolumn number, and then the row number. Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the\\nnames and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in\\nthe 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher’s desk is not part of your seating\\nplan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCOORDINATE GEOMETRY\\n45\\nFig. 3.3\\nIn the discussion above, you observe that position of any object lying in a plane\\ncan be represented with the help of two perpendicular lines. In case of ‘dot’, we\\nrequire distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper. In\\ncase of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row. This\\nsimple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important\\nbranch of Mathematics known as Coordinate Geometry. In this chapter, we aim to\\nintroduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry. You will study more about\\nthese in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher\\nand mathematician René Déscartes.\\nRené Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the\\nseventeenth century, liked to lie in bed and think! One\\nday, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of\\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane. His method\\nwas a development of the older idea of latitude and\\nlongitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for\\ndescribing the position of a point in a plane is also\\nknown as the Cartesian system.\\nRené Déscartes (1596 -1650)\\nFig. 3.4\\nEXERCISE 3.1\\n1.\\nHow will you describe the position of a table lamp on your study table to another\\nperson?\\n2.\\n(Street Plan) : A city has two main roads which cross each other at the centre of the\\ncity.

There\\nare 5 streets in each direction. Using 1cm = 200 m, draw a model of the city on your\\nnotebook. Represent the roads/streets by single lines.\\nThere are many cross- streets in your model. A particular cross-street is made by\\ntwo streets, one running in the North - South direction and another in the East - West\\ndirection. Each cross street is referred to in the following manner : If the 2nd street\\nrunning in the North - South direction and 5th in the East - West direction meet at some\\ncrossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5). Using this convention, find:\\n(i)\\nhow many cross - streets can be referred to as (4, 3).\\n(ii) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (3, 4).\\n3.2 Cartesian System\\nYou have studied the number line in the chapter on ‘Number System’. On the number\\nline, distances from a fixed point are marked in equal units positively in one direction\\nand negatively in the other. The point from which the distances are marked is called\\nthe origin. We use the number line to represent the numbers by marking points on a\\nline at equal distances. If one unit distance represents the number ‘1’, then 3 units\\ndistance represents the number ‘3’, ‘0’ being at the origin. The point in the positive\\ndirection at a distance r from the origin represents the number r. The point in the\\nnegative direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number −r. Locations\\nof different numbers on the number line are shown in Fig. 3.5.\\nFig. 3.5\\nDescartes invented the idea of placing two such lines perpendicular to each other\\non a plane, and locating points on the plane by referring them to these lines. The\\nperpendicular lines may be in any direction such as in Fig.3.6. But, when we choose\\nFig. 3.6\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCOORDINATE GEOMETRY\\n47\\nthese two lines to locate a point in a plane in this chapter, one line\\nwill be horizontal and the other will be vertical, as in Fig. 3.6(c).\\nThese lines are actually obtained as follows : Take two number\\nlines, calling them X′X and Y′Y. Place X′X horizontal [as in Fig. 3.7(a)]\\nand write the numbers on it just as written on the number line. We do\\nthe same thing with Y′Y except that Y′Y is vertical, not horizontal\\n[Fig. 3.7(b)].\\nFig. 3.7\\nCombine both the lines in such\\na way that the two lines cross each\\nother at their zeroes, or origins\\n(Fig. 3.8). The horizontal line X′X\\nis called the x - axis and the vertical\\nline YY′ is called the y - axis. The\\npoint where X′X and Y′Y cross is\\ncalled the origin, and is denoted\\nby O. Since the positive numbers\\nlie on the directions OX and OY,\\nOX and OY are called the positive\\ndirections of the x - axis and the\\ny - axis, respectively. Similarly, OX′\\nand OY′ are called the negative\\ndirections of the x - axis and the\\ny - axis, respectively.\\nFig. 3.8\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c48\\nMATHEMATICS\\nYou observe that the axes (plural of the word\\n‘axis’) divide the plane into four parts. These four\\nparts are called the quadrants (one fourth part),\\nnumbered I, II, III and IV anticlockwise from OX\\n(see Fig.3.9). So, the plane consists of the axes and\\nthese quadrants. We call the plane, the Cartesian\\nplane, or the coordinate plane, or the xy-plane.\\nThe axes are called the coordinate axes.\\nFig. 3.9\\nNow, let us see why this system is so basic to mathematics, and how it is useful.\\nConsider the following diagram where the axes are drawn on graph paper.

The y - coordinate is also called the ordinate.\\n(iii) In stating the coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, the x - coordinate\\ncomes first, and then the y - coordinate. We place the coordinates in brackets.\\nHence, the coordinates of P are (4, 3) and the coordinates of Q are (– 6, – 2).\\nNote that the coordinates describe a point in the plane uniquely.

Can you write\\ndown a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + \\n2  = 0 and\\n2 y + 3  = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that\\nsuch equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember\\nhow to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear\\nequations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You\\nwill be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a\\nsolution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane?\\nYou shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions.\\n4.2 Linear Equations\\nLet us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation:\\n2x + 5 = 0\\nIts solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is \\n5\\n2\\n−\\n. This can be represented on the\\nnumber line as shown below:\\nFig. 4.1\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c56\\nMATHEMATICS\\nWhile solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind:\\nThe solution of a linear equation is not affected when:\\n(i)\\nthe same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation.\\n(ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero\\nnumber.\\nLet us now consider the following situation:\\nIn a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in\\nNagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the\\nform of an equation.\\nHere, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two\\nunknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored\\nby one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know\\nthat\\nx + y = 176,\\nwhich is the required equation.\\nThis is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote\\nthe variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some\\nexamples of linear equations in two variables are:\\n1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q = 7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = \\n2 x – 7y.\\nNote that you can put these equations in the form 1.2s + 3t – 5 = 0,\\np + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and \\n2 x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively.\\nSo, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c\\nare real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two\\nvariables. This means that you can think of many many such equations.\\nExample 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and\\nindicate the values of a, b and c in each case:\\n(i) 2x + 3y = 4.37\\n(ii) x – 4 = \\n3 y\\n(iii) 4 = 5x – 3y\\n(iv) 2x = y\\nSolution : (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y – 4.37 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3\\nand c = – 4.37.\\n(ii)\\nThe equation x – 4 = \\n3 y can be written as x – \\n3 y – 4 = 0. Here a = 1,\\nb = –\\n3  and c = – 4.\\n(iii) The equation 4 = 5x – 3y can be written as 5x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 5, b = –3\\nand c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this\\ncase a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cLINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES\\n57\\n(iv) The equation 2x = y can be written as 2x – y + 0 = 0. Here a = 2, b = –1 and\\nc = 0.\\nEquations of the type ax + b = 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables\\nbecause they can be expressed as\\nax + 0.y + b = 0\\nFor example, 4 – 3x = 0 can be written as –3x + 0.y + 4 = 0.\\nExample 2 : Write each of the following as an equation in two variables:\\n(i) x = –5\\n(ii) y = 2\\n(iii) 2x = 3\\n(iv) 5y = 2\\nSolution : (i) x = –5 can be written as 1.x + 0.y = –5, or 1.x + 0.y + 5 = 0.\\n(ii) y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 1.y = 2, or 0.x + 1.y – 2 = 0.\\n(iii) 2x = 3 can be written as 2x + 0.y – 3 = 0.\\n(iv) 5y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 5y – 2 = 0.\\nEXERCISE 4.1\\n1.\\nThe cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen.

What\\ncan you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables?

As there\\nare two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one\\nfor y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12.\\nHere, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the\\nequation above, you find that\\n2x + 3y = (2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12\\nThis solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and\\nthen the value for y. Similarly, (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c58\\nMATHEMATICS\\nOn the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 12, because on putting\\nx = 1 and y = 4 we get 2x + 3y = 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but\\nnot (4, 0).\\nYou have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can\\nyou find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the\\nsame. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of\\nyour choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12,\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8f6\\n is\\nwhich is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y = 8\\n3.

So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two\\nvariables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.\\nExample 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6.\\nSolution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2\\nx + 2y = 2 + 4 = 6\\nNow, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6\\nwhich has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6.\\nSimilarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y = 0 is a solution\\nof x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to\\nx + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the\\ngiven equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are:\\n(2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1).\\nRemark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the\\ncorresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding\\nvalue of x.\\nExample 4 : Find two solutions for each of the following equations:\\n(i)\\n4x + 3y = 12\\n(ii) 2x + 5y = 0\\n(iii) 3y + 4 = 0\\nSolution : (i) Taking x = 0, we get 3y = 12, i.e., y = 4.

Geometry appears to have originated from\\nthe need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various\\nforms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece,\\nthe Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems\\nwhich required the development of geometry in various ways.\\nFig. 5.1 : A Truncated Pyramid\\nFor example, whenever the river Nile\\noverflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between\\nthe adjoining fields of different land owners. After\\nsuch flooding, these boundaries had to be\\nredrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians\\ndeveloped a number of geometric techniques and\\nrules for calculating simple areas and also for\\ndoing simple constructions. The knowledge of\\ngeometry was also used by them for computing\\nvolumes of granaries, and for constructing canals\\nand pyramids. They also knew the correct formula\\nto find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see\\nFig. 5.1).You know that a pyramid is a solid figure,\\nthe base of which is a triangle, or square, or some\\nother polygon, and its side faces are triangles\\nconverging to a point at the top.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cINTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY\\n61\\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, etc.\\nshow that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 BCE) made extensive use of\\ngeometry. It was a highly organised society. The cities were highly developed and\\nvery well planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was\\nan underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This\\nshows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic.\\nThe bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness,\\nof the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1.\\nIn ancient India, the Sulbasutras (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the manuals of\\ngeometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the\\nconstruction of altars (or vedis) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location\\nof the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about\\ntheir shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular\\naltars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations\\nof rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra\\n(given in the Atharvaveda) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These\\ntriangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though\\naccurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles\\nbehind them were not discussed.\\nThese examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere\\nin the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner. What is interesting\\nabout these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed\\non from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by\\nother ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained\\na very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry\\ndeveloped by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no\\ngeneral rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry\\nmostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science.\\nBut in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning behind why certain\\nconstructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the\\nstatements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1).\\nA Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the\\nfirst known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle\\nis bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter. One of\\nThales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BCE), whom\\nyou have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many\\ngeometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a\\ngreat extent. This process continued till 300 BCE. At that time\\nEuclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected\\nall the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise,\\nThales\\n(640 BCE – 546 BCE)\\nFig. 5.2\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c62\\nMATHEMATICS\\ncalled ‘Elements’.

The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on\\nwere derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids\\nin the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed.\\nA solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its\\nboundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another,\\nand are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves or\\nstraight lines. These lines end in points.\\nConsider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In\\neach step we lose one extension, also called a dimension. So, a solid has three\\ndimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised\\nthese statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in\\nBook 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below :\\n1.\\nA point  is that which has no part.\\n2.\\nA line is breadthless length.\\n3.\\nThe ends of a line are points.\\n4.\\nA straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\\n5.\\nA surface is that which has length and breadth only.\\n6.\\nThe edges of a surface are lines.\\n7.\\nA plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\\nIf you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part,\\nbreadth, length, evenly, etc. need to be further explained clearly. For example, consider\\nhis definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you\\ndefine ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined.\\nSo, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long\\nchain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leave\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cINTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY\\n63\\nsome geometric terms undefined. However, we do have a intuitive feeling for the\\ngeometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent\\na point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension.\\nA similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length,\\nneither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined\\nwhile developing any course of study. So, in geometry, we take a point, a line and a\\nplane (in Euclid‘s words a plane surface) as undefined terms. The only thing is\\nthat we can represent them intuitively, or explain them with the help of ‘physical\\nmodels’.\\nStarting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to\\nbe proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them\\ninto two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘postulate’ for the assumptions\\nthat were specific to geometry. Common notions (often called axioms), on the other\\nhand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to\\ngeometry. For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of\\nEuclid’s axioms, not in his order, are given below :\\n(1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.\\n(2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.\\n(3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.\\n(4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.\\n(5) The whole is greater than the part.\\n(6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another.\\n(7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.\\nThese ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common\\nnotion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the\\narea of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area\\nof the triangle also equals the area of the square.\\nMagnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of\\ndifferent kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be compared to a\\nrectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon.\\nThe 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is,\\nthey are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is\\nthe justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of\\n‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can\\nbe written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically, A > B means that',\n",

They are :\\nPostulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.\\nNote that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two\\ndistinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However,\\nin his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique\\nline joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:\\nAxiom 5.1 : Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through\\nthem.\\nHow many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one,\\nthat is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one,\\nthat is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an\\naxiom.\\nFig. 5.4\\nPostulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.\\nNote that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated\\nline. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line\\nsegment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5).\\nFig. 5.5\\nPostulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.\\nPostulate 4 : All right angles are equal to one another.\\nPostulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior\\nangles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the\\ntwo straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of\\nangles is less than two right angles.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cINTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY\\n65\\nFor example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines\\nAB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1\\nand 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ.\\nTherefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually\\nintersect on the left side of PQ.\\nFig. 5.6\\nA brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more\\ncomplex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so\\nsimple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However, it is not\\npossible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof\\n(see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more\\nattention in the next section.\\nNow-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably\\nand in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”,\\nwe mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the\\nUniverse”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a\\n‘Postulate’.\\nA system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to\\ndeduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved\\nstatement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the\\nsystem is consistent.\\nAfter Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.\\nThen using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning.\\nThe statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems. Euclid\\ndeduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and\\ntheorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will\\nbe using these axioms to prove some theorems.\\nNow, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates\\nfor proving some of the results:\\nExample 1 : If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C\\n(see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.\\nFig. 5.7\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c66\\nMATHEMATICS\\nSolution : In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC.\\nAlso, Euclid’s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to\\none another. So, it can be deduced that\\nAB + BC = AC\\nNote that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing\\nthrough two points.\\nExample 2 : Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line\\nsegment.\\nSolution : In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB\\n[see Fig. 5.8(i)].\\nFig. 5.8\\nHere, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’s Postulate 3, you can draw a\\ncircle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly, draw',\n",

Similarly, draw\\nanother circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at\\na point, say C. Now, draw the line segments AC and BC to form ∆ ABC\\n[see Fig. 5.8 (iii)].\\nSo, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC.\\nNow,\\nAB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle\\n(1)\\nSimilarly, AB = BC\\n(Radii of the same circle)\\n(2)\\nFrom these two facts, and Euclid’s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing\\nare equal to one another, you can conclude that AB = BC = AC.\\nSo, ∆ ABC is an equilateral triangle.\\nNote that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles\\ndrawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.\\nNow we prove a theorem, which is frequently used in different results:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cINTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY\\n67\\nTheorem 5.1 : Two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.\\nProof : Here we are given two lines l and m.

       " 'CHAPTER 6\\nLINES AND ANGLES\\n6.1 Introduction\\nIn Chapter 5, you have studied that a minimum of two points are required to draw a\\nline. You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you\\nproved some other statements. In this chapter, you will study the properties of the\\nangles formed when two lines intersect each other, and also the properties of the\\nangles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.\\nFurther you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning\\n(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities\\nin the earlier classes.\\nIn your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of\\nplane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need\\nto have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a\\nmodel of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you\\nwould make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other, and some\\nsticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried\\nbuilding, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at different angles. Without\\nthe knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw\\nthe layout of the building?\\nIn science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.\\nFor example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium\\nto the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.\\nWhen two or more forces act on a body, you draw the diagram in which forces are\\nrepresented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the\\nbody. At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays\\n(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other. To find the height of a tower\\nor to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c70\\nMATHEMATICS\\nformed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be\\ngiven where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry, you\\nwill be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful\\nproperties.\\nLet us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in\\nearlier classes.\\n6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions\\nRecall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment\\nand a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is\\n\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x02 , and\\ndenoted by AB , and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB\\na line is denoted by AB\\n\\x03\\x01\\x01\\x02 . However, we will not use these symbols, and will denote\\nthe line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The\\nmeaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be\\nused to denote lines.\\nIf three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points;\\notherwise they are called non-collinear points.\\nRecall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\\nThe rays making an angle are called the arms of the angle and the end point is called\\nthe vertex of the angle. You have studied different types of angles, such as acute\\nangle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes\\n(see Fig. 6.1).\\n(i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90°\\n(ii) right angle : y = 90°\\n(iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180°\\n(iv) straight angle : s = 180°\\n(v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360°\\nFig. 6.1 : Types of Angles\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cLINES AND ANGLES\\n71\\nAn acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right angle is exactly\\nequal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle.\\nAlso, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180°\\nbut less than 360° is called a reflex angle. Further, two angles whose sum is 90° are\\ncalled complementary angles, and two angles whose sum is 180° are called\\nsupplementary angles.\\nFig. 6.2 : Adjacent angles\\nYou have also studied about adjacent angles\\nin the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles\\nare adjacent, if they have a common vertex, a\\ncommon arm and their non-common arms are\\non different sides of the common arm. In\\nFig. 6.2, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are adjacent\\nangles. Ray BD is their common arm and point\\nB is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC\\nare non common arms. Moreover, when two\\nangles are adjacent, then their sum is always\\nequal to the angle formed by the two non-\\ncommon arms. So, we can write\\n∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC.\\nNote that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not\\nadjacent angles. Why? Because their non-\\ncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side\\nof the common arm BA.\\nFig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles\\nIf the non-common arms BA and BC in\\nFig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.',\n",
       " 'B is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC\\nare non common arms. Moreover, when two\\nangles are adjacent, then their sum is always\\nequal to the angle formed by the two non-\\ncommon arms. So, we can write\\n∠ ABC = ∠ ABD + ∠ DBC.\\nNote that ∠ ABC and ∠ ABD are not\\nadjacent angles. Why? Because their non-\\ncommon arms BD and BC lie on the same side\\nof the common arm BA.\\nFig. 6.3 : Linear pair of angles\\nIf the non-common arms BA and BC in\\nFig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.\\nIn this case, ∠ ABD and ∠ DBC are called\\nlinear pair of angles.\\nYou may also recall the vertically opposite\\nangles formed when two lines, say AB and CD,\\nintersect each other, say at the point O\\n(see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically\\nopposite angles.\\nOne pair is ∠AOD and ∠BOC. Can you\\nfind the other pair?\\nFig. 6.4 : Vertically opposite\\nangles\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c72\\nMATHEMATICS\\n6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines\\nDraw two different lines PQ and RS on a paper. You will see that you can draw them\\nin two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (ii).\\n(i) Intersecting lines\\n(ii) Non-intersecting (parallel) lines\\nFig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines\\nRecall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ\\nand RS in Fig. 6.5 (i) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (ii) are parallel lines. Note\\nthat the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel\\nlines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines.\\n6.4 Pairs of Angles\\nFig. 6.6 : Linear pair of angles\\nIn Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of\\nsome of the pairs of angles such as\\ncomplementary angles, supplementary angles,\\nadjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can\\nyou think of some relations between these\\nangles? Now, let us find out the relation between\\nthe angles formed when a ray stands on a line.\\nDraw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as\\nshown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the\\nray as OC. What are the angles formed at the\\npoint O? They are ∠ AOC, ∠ BOC and ∠ AOB.\\nCan we write ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = ∠ AOB?\\n(1)\\nYes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2)\\nWhat is the measure of ∠ AOB? It is 180°.\\n(Why?)\\n(2)\\nFrom (1) and (2), can you say that ∠ AOC + ∠ BOC = 180°?\\nYes! (Why?)\\nFrom the above discussion, we can state the following Axiom:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cLINES AND ANGLES\\n73\\nAxiom 6.1 : If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so\\nformed is 180°.\\nRecall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a\\nlinear pair of angles.\\nIn Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have\\nconcluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write\\nAxiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’ of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’ and\\nthe ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes:\\n(A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is,\\nthe non-common arms form a line).\\nNow you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of\\neach others. We call each as converse of the other. We do not know whether the\\nstatement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures\\nas shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case.\\nDoes the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?\\nFig. 6.7 : Adjacent angles with different measures\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c74\\nMATHEMATICS\\nYou will find that only in Fig. 6.7 (iii), both the non-common arms lie along the\\nruler, that is, points A, O and B lie on the same line and ray OC stands on it. Also see\\nthat ∠ AOC + ∠ COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement\\n(A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows:\\nAxiom 6.2 : If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then the non-common arms\\nof the angles form a line.\\nFor obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair\\nAxiom.\\nLet us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other.\\nRecall, from earlier classes,  that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite\\nangles are equal. Let us prove this result now. See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a\\nproof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below.\\nTheorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite\\nangles are equal.\\nProof : In the statement above, it is given\\nthat ‘two lines intersect each other’. So, let\\nAB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as\\nshown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of\\nvertically opposite angles, namely,\\nFig. 6.8 : Vertically opposite angles\\n(i) ∠ AOC and ∠ BOD (ii) ∠ AOD and\\n∠ BOC.\\nWe need to prove that ∠ AOC = ∠ BOD\\nand ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.\\nNow, ray OA stands on line CD.\\nTherefore, ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = 180°\\n(Linear pair axiom) (1)\\nCan we write ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?)\\n(2)\\nFrom (1) and (2), we can write\\n                                  ∠ AOC + ∠ AOD = ∠ AOD + ∠ BOD',\n",

       " 'CHAPTER 7\\nTRIANGLES\\n7.1 Introduction\\nYou have studied about triangles and their various properties in your earlier classes.\\nYou know that a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines is called a triangle.\\n(‘Tri’ means ‘three’). A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices. For\\nexample, in triangle ABC, denoted as ∆ ABC (see Fig. 7.1); AB, BC, CA are the three\\nsides, ∠ A, ∠ B, ∠ C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices.\\nIn Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties\\nof triangles. In this chapter, you will study in details\\nabout the congruence of triangles, rules of congruence,\\nsome more properties of triangles and inequalities in\\na triangle. You have already verified most of these\\nproperties in earlier classes. We will now prove some\\nof them.\\nFig. 7.1\\n7.2 Congruence of Triangles\\nYou must have observed that two copies of your photographs of the same size are\\nidentical. Similarly, two bangles of the same size, two ATM cards issued by the same\\nbank are identical. You may recall that on placing a one rupee coin on another minted\\nin the same year, they cover each other completely.\\nDo you remember what such figures are called? Indeed they are called congruent\\nfigures (‘congruent’ means equal in all respects or figures whose shapes and sizes\\nare both the same).\\nNow, draw two circles of the same radius and place one on the other. What do\\nyou observe? They cover each other completely and we call them as congruent circles.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c84\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFig. 7.2\\nRepeat this activity by placing one\\nsquare on the other with sides of the same\\nmeasure (see Fig. 7.2) or by placing two\\nequilateral triangles of equal sides on each\\nother. You will observe that the squares are\\ncongruent to each other and so are the\\nequilateral triangles.\\nYou may wonder why we are studying congruence. You all must have seen the ice\\ntray in your refrigerator. Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent.\\nThe cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are\\nrectangular or all circular or all triangular). So, whenever identical objects have to be\\nproduced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast.\\nSometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one\\nand this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to\\nremove. Obviously, if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits.\\nSo, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in\\ndaily life situations.\\nCan you think of some more examples of congruent figures?\\nNow, which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in\\nFig 7.3 (i) :\\nFig. 7.3\\nThe large squares in Fig. 7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in\\nFig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).\\nLet us now discuss the congruence of two triangles.\\nYou already know that two triangles are congruent if the sides and angles of one\\ntriangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of the other triangle.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cTRIANGLES\\n85\\nNow, which of the triangles given below are congruent to triangle ABC in\\nFig. 7.4 (i)?\\nFig. 7.4\\nCut out each of these triangles from Fig. 7.4 (ii) to (v) and turn them around and\\ntry to cover ∆ ABC. Observe that triangles in Fig. 7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent\\nto ∆ ABC while ∆ TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to ∆ ABC.\\nIf ∆ PQR is congruent to ∆ ABC, we write ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC.\\nNotice that when ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC, then sides of ∆ PQR fall on corresponding\\nequal sides of ∆ ABC and so is the case for the angles.\\nThat is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP covers CA; ∠ P  covers ∠ A,\\n∠ Q covers ∠ B and ∠ R covers ∠ C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence\\nbetween the vertices. That is, P corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is\\nwritten as\\nP ↔ A, Q ↔ B, R ↔ C\\nNote that under this correspondence, ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC; but it will not be correct to\\nwrite ∆QRP ≅ ∆ ABC.\\nSimilarly, for Fig. 7.4 (iii),\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c86\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFD ↔ AB, DE ↔ BC and EF ↔ CA\\nand\\nF ↔ A, D ↔ B and E ↔ C\\nSo, ∆ FDE ≅ ∆ ABC but writing ∆ DEF ≅ ∆ ABC is not correct.\\nGive the correspondence between the triangle in Fig. 7.4 (iv) and ∆ ABC.\\nSo, it is necessary to write the correspondence of vertices correctly for writing of\\ncongruence of triangles in symbolic form.\\nNote that in congruent triangles corresponding parts are equal and we write\\nin short ‘CPCT’ for corresponding parts of congruent triangles.\\n7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles\\nIn earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles.

Are\\nthey congruent?\\nFig. 7.6\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cTRIANGLES\\n87\\nSee that these two triangles are not congruent.\\nRepeat this activity with some more pairs of triangles.\\nSo, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not\\nsufficient to give us congruent triangles.\\nWhat would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also\\nequal?\\nIn Fig 7.7, BC = QR, ∠ B = ∠ Q and also, AB = PQ. Now, what can you say\\nabout congruence of ∆ABC and ∆PQR?\\nRecall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent.\\nVerify this for ∆ ABC and ∆ PQR in Fig. 7.7.\\nRepeat this activity with other pairs of triangles. Do you observe that the equality\\nof two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles? Yes, it\\nis enough.\\nFig. 7.7\\nThis is the first criterion for congruence of triangles.\\nAxiom 7.1 (SAS congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two sides\\nand the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included\\nangle of the other triangle.\\nThis result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is\\naccepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1).\\nLet us now take some examples.\\nExample 1 : In Fig. 7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC. Show that\\n(i) ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC and\\n(ii) AD || BC.\\nSolution : (i) You may observe that in ∆ AOD and ∆ BOC,\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8fe\\nOA = OB\\n(Given)\\nOD = OC\\nFig. 7.8\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c88\\nMATHEMATICS\\nAlso, since ∠ AOD and ∠ BOC form a pair of vertically opposite angles, we have\\n∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.\\nSo,\\n∆ AOD ≅∆ BOC\\n(by the SAS congruence rule)\\n(ii) In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also\\nequal.\\nSo,\\n∠ OAD = ∠ OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments\\nAD and BC.\\nTherefore,\\nAD || BC.\\nExample 2 : AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector. If a point P\\nlies on l, show that P is equidistant from A and B.\\nSolution : Line l ⊥ AB and passes through C which\\nis the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to\\nshow that PA = PB. Consider ∆ PCA and ∆ PCB.\\nWe have\\nAC = BC\\n(C is the mid-point of AB)\\n∠ PCA = ∠ PCB = 90°\\n (Given)\\nPC = PC\\n (Common)\\nSo,\\n∆ PCA ≅ ∆ PCB (SAS rule)\\nFig. 7.9\\nand so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of\\ncongruent triangles.\\nNow, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the\\nangles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10).\\nAre the two triangles congruent?\\nFig. 7.10\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cTRIANGLES\\n89\\nNotice that the two triangles are not congruent.\\nRepeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that for triangles\\nto be congruent, it is very important that the equal angles are included between the\\npairs of equal sides.\\nSo, SAS congruence rule holds but not ASS or SSA rule.\\nNext, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60° and 45° and\\nthe side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig. 7.11).\\nFig. 7.11\\nCut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other. What do you observe?\\nSee that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent.\\nRepeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that equality of two\\nangles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles.\\nThis result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as\\nASA criterion. You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and\\nprove this result.\\nSince this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the\\nSAS axiom for congruence.\\nTheorem 7.1  (ASA congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two angles\\nand the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included\\nside of other triangle.\\nProof : We are given two triangles ABC and DEF in which:\\n∠ B = ∠ E, ∠ C = ∠ F\\nand\\nBC = EF\\nWe need to prove that\\n∆ ABC ≅∆ DEF\\nFor proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c90\\nMATHEMATICS\\nCase (i) : Let AB = DE (see Fig. 7.12).\\nNow what do you observe?

Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent.\\nCan you reason out why?\\nYou know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°. So if two pairs of\\nangles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles).\\nSo, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of\\ncorresponding sides are equal. We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule.\\nNow let us perform the following activity :\\nDraw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°.

A quadrilateral\\nhas four sides, four angles and four vertices. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in\\nwhich both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.\\nLet us perform an activity.\\nCut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper\\nand cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.1). You obtain\\ntwo triangles. What can you say about these\\ntriangles?\\nPlace one triangle over the other. Turn one around,\\nif necessary. What do you observe?\\nFig. 8.1\\nObserve that the two triangles are congruent to\\neach other.\\nRepeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe\\nthat each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.\\nLet us now prove this result.\\nTheorem 8.1 : A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent\\ntriangles.\\nProof : Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.2). Observe\\nthat the diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two triangles, namely, ∆ ABC\\nand ∆ CDA. We need to prove that these triangles are congruent.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cQUADRILATERALS\\n105\\nIn ∆ ABC and ∆ CDA, note that BC || AD and AC is a transversal.\\nSo,\\n∠ BCA = ∠ DAC (Pair of alternate angles)\\nAlso,\\nAB || DC and AC is a transversal.\\nSo,\\n∠ BAC = ∠ DCA (Pair of alternate angles)\\nand\\nAC = CA\\n(Common)\\nFig. 8.2\\nSo,\\n∆ ABC ≅ ∆ CDA\\n(ASA rule)\\nor,\\ndiagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two congruent\\ntriangles ABC and CDA.\\nNow, measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe?\\nYou will find that AB = DC and AD = BC.\\nThis is another property of a parallelogram stated below:\\nTheorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.\\nYou have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent\\ntriangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say, the corresponding\\nsides? They are equal.\\nSo,\\nAB = DC\\nand\\nAD = BC\\nNow what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given\\nin a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the\\ntheorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below :\\nIf a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So\\nits converse is :\\nTheorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it\\nis a parallelogram.\\nCan you reason out why?\\nLet sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD\\nbe equal and also  AD = BC (see Fig. 8.3). Draw\\ndiagonal AC.\\nClearly,\\n∆ ABC ≅∆ CDA\\n(Why?)\\nSo,\\n∠ BAC = ∠ DCA\\nFig. 8.3\\nand\\n∠ BCA = ∠ DAC\\n(Why?)\\nCan you now say that ABCD is a parallelogram? Why?\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c106\\nMATHEMATICS\\nYou have just seen that in a parallelogram each pair of opposite sides is equal and\\nconversely if each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a\\nparallelogram. Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles?\\nDraw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe?\\nEach pair of opposite angles is equal.\\nRepeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as\\ngiven below.\\nTheorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.\\nNow, is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of\\na quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see\\nthat the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem :\\nTheorem 8.5 : If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then\\nit is a parallelogram.\\nThere is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a\\nparallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O\\n(see Fig. 8.4).\\nMeasure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD.\\nWhat do you observe? You will observe that\\nOA = OC\\nand\\nOB = OD.\\nor,\\nO is the mid-point of both the diagonals.\\nRepeat this activity with some more parallelograms.\\nFig. 8.4\\nEach time you will find that O is the mid-point of\\nboth the diagonals.\\nSo, we have the following theorem :\\nTheorem 8.6 : The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\\nNow, what would happen, if in a quadrilateral the diagonals bisect each other?\\nWill it be aparallelogram? Indeed this is true.\\nThis result is the converse of the result of Theorem 8.6.

What are angles POQ, PRQ and PSQ called in Fig. 9.2? ∠ POQ is the\\nangle subtended by the chord PQ at the centre O, ∠ PRQ and ∠ PSQ are respectively\\nthe angles subtended by PQ at points R and S on the major and minor arcs PQ.\\nFig. 9.1\\n            Fig. 9.2\\nLet us examine the relationship between the size of the chord and the angle\\nsubtended by it at the centre. You may see by drawing different chords of a circle\\nand  angles subtended by them at the centre that the longer is the chord, the bigger\\nwill be the angle subtended by it at the centre. What will happen if you take two\\nequal chords of a circle? Will the angles subtended at the centre be the same\\nor not?\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCIRCLES\\n117\\nDraw two or more equal chords of a circle and\\nmeasure the angles subtended by them at the centre\\n(see Fig.9.3). You will find that the angles subtended\\nby them at the centre are equal. Let us give a proof\\nof this fact.\\nTheorem 9.1 : Equal chords of a circle subtend\\nequal angles at the centre.\\nFig. 9.3\\nProof : You are given two equal chords AB and CD\\nof a circle with centre O (see Fig.9.4). You want to\\nprove that ∠ AOB = ∠ COD.\\nIn triangles AOB and COD,\\nOA = OC\\n(Radii of a circle)\\nOB = OD\\n(Radii of a circle)\\nAB = CD\\n(Given)\\nTherefore,\\n∆ AOB ≅∆ COD\\n(SSS rule)\\nThis gives\\n∠ AOB = ∠ COD\\n               (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)\\nFig. 9.4\\nRemark : For convenience, the abbreviation CPCT will be used in place of\\n‘Corresponding parts of congruent triangles’, because we use this very frequently as\\nyou will see.\\nNow if two chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre, what can you\\nsay about the chords? Are they equal or not? Let us examine this by the following\\nactivity:\\nTake a tracing paper and trace a circle on it. Cut\\nit along the circle to get a disc. At its centre O, draw\\nan angle AOB where A, B are points on the circle.\\nMake another angle POQ at the centre equal to\\n∠AOB. Cut the disc along AB and PQ\\n(see Fig. 9.5). You will get two segments ACB and\\nPRQ of the circle. If you put one on the other, what\\ndo you observe? They cover each other, i.e., they\\nare congruent. So AB  = PQ.\\nFig. 9.5\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c118\\nMATHEMATICS\\nThough you have seen it for this particular case, try it out for other equal angles\\ntoo. The chords will all turn out to be equal because of the following theorem:\\nTheorem 9.2 : If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the centre are\\nequal, then the chords are equal.\\nThe above theorem is the converse of the Theorem 9.1. Note that in Fig. 9.4, if\\nyou take ∠ AOB = ∠ COD, then\\n           ∆ AOB ≅ ∆ COD (Why?)\\nCan you now see that AB = CD?\\nEXERCISE 9.1\\n1.\\nRecall that two circles are congruent if they have the same radii. Prove that equal\\nchords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres.\\n2.\\nProve that if chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres, then\\nthe chords are equal.\\n9.2 Perpendicular from the Centre to a Chord\\nActivity : Draw a circle on a tracing paper. Let O\\nbe its centre. Draw a chord AB. Fold the paper along\\na line through O so that a portion of the chord falls on\\nthe other. Let the crease cut AB at the point M. Then,\\n∠ OMA = ∠ OMB = 90° or OM is perpendicular to\\nAB. Does the point B coincide with A (see Fig.9.6)?\\nFig. 9.6\\nYes it will. So MA = MB.\\nGive a proof yourself by joining OA and OB and proving the right triangles OMA\\nand OMB to be congruent. This example is a particular instance of the following\\nresult:\\nTheorem 9.3 : The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects\\nthe chord.\\nWhat is the converse of this theorem? To write this, first let us be clear what is\\nassumed in Theorem 9.3 and what is proved. Given that the perpendicular from the\\ncentre of a circle to a chord is drawn and to prove that it bisects the chord. Thus in the\\nconverse, what the hypothesis is ‘if a line from the centre bisects a chord of a\\ncircle’ and what is to be proved is ‘the line is perpendicular to the chord’. So the\\nconverse is:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCIRCLES\\n119\\nTheorem 9.4 : The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is\\nperpendicular to the chord.\\nIs this true? Try it for few cases and see. You will\\nsee that it is true for these cases. See if it is true, in\\ngeneral, by doing the following exercise. We will write\\nthe stages and you give the reasons.\\nLet AB be a chord of a circle with centre O and\\nO is joined to the mid-point M of AB. You have to\\nprove that OM ⊥ AB. Join OA and OB\\n(see Fig. 9.7). In triangles OAM and OBM,\\nOA = OB\\n(Why ?)\\nAM = BM\\n(Why ?)\\nFig. 9.7\\nOM = OM\\n(Common)\\nTherefore, ∆OAM ≅∆OBM\\n(How ?)\\nThis gives ∠OMA = ∠OMB = 90°    (Why ?)',\n",

Since there are\\ninfinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these\\npoints to P, you will get infinitely many line segments\\nPL1, PL2, PM, PL3, PL4, etc. Which of these is the\\ndistance of AB from P? You may think a while and\\nget the answer. Out of these line segments, the\\nperpendicular from P to AB, namely PM in Fig. 9.8,\\nwill be the least. In Mathematics, we define this least\\nlength PM to be the distance of AB from P. So you\\nmay say that:\\nThe length of the perpendicular from a point to a line is the distance of the\\nline from the point.\\nNote that if the point lies on the line, the distance of the line from the point is zero.\\nA circle can have infinitely many chords. You may observe by drawing chords of\\na circle that longer chord is nearer to the centre than the smaller chord. You may\\nobserve it by drawing several chords of a circle of different lengths and measuring\\ntheir distances from the centre.  What is the distance of the diameter, which is the\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c120\\nMATHEMATICS\\nlongest chord from the centre? Since the centre lies on it, the distance is zero. Do you\\nthink that there is some relationship between the length of chords and their distances\\nfrom the centre? Let us see if this is so.\\nFig. 9.9\\nActivity : Draw a circle of any radius on a tracing paper. Draw two equal chords\\nAB and CD of it and also the perpendiculars OM and ON on them from the centre\\nO. Fold the figure so that D falls on B and C falls on A [see Fig.9.9 (i)]. You may\\nobserve that O lies on the crease and N falls on M. Therefore, OM = ON. Repeat\\nthe activity by drawing congruent circles with centres O and O′ and taking equal\\nchords AB and CD one on each. Draw perpendiculars OM and O′N on them [see\\nFig. 9.9(ii)]. Cut one circular disc and put it on the other so that AB coincides with\\nCD. Then you will find that O coincides with O′ and M coincides with N. In this\\nway you verified the following:\\nTheorem 9.5 : Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant\\nfrom the centre (or centres).\\nNext, it will be seen whether the converse of this theorem is true or not. For\\nthis, draw a circle with centre O. From the centre O, draw two line segments OL\\nand OM of equal length and lying inside the circle [see Fig. 9.10(i)]. Then draw\\nchords PQ and RS of the circle perpendicular to OL and OM respectively [see Fig\\n9.10(ii)]. Measure the lengths of PQ and RS. Are these different? No, both are\\nequal. Repeat the activity for more equal line segments and drawing the chords\\nperpendicular to them. This verifies the converse of the Theorem 9.5 which is stated\\nas follows:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCIRCLES\\n121\\nFig. 9.10\\nTheorem 9.6 : Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal in length.\\nWe now take an example to illustrate the use of the above results:\\nExample 1 : If two intersecting chords of a circle make equal angles with the diameter\\npassing through their point of intersection, prove that the chords are equal.\\nSolution : Given that AB and CD are two chords of\\na circle, with centre O intersecting at a point E.

Find the length of the string of each phone.\\n9.4 Angle Subtended by an Arc of a Circle\\nYou have seen that the end points of a chord other than diameter of a circle cuts it into\\ntwo arcs – one major and other minor. If you take two equal chords, what can you say\\nabout the size of arcs? Is one arc made by first chord equal to the corresponding arc\\nmade by another chord? In fact, they are more than just equal in length. They are\\ncongruent in the sense that if one arc is put on the other, without bending or twisting,\\none superimposes the other completely.\\nFig. 9.13\\nYou can verify this fact by cutting the arc,\\ncorresponding to the chord CD from the circle along\\nCD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal\\nchord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose\\nthe arc AB completely  (see Fig. 9.13). This shows\\nthat equal chords make congruent arcs and\\nconversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a\\ncircle. You can state it as follows:\\nIf two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs are congruent\\nand conversely, if two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCIRCLES\\n123\\nAlso the angle subtended by an arc at the centre\\nis defined to be angle subtended by the corresponding\\nchord at the centre in the sense that the minor arc\\nsubtends the angle and the major arc subtends the\\nreflex angle. Therefore, in Fig 9.14, the angle\\nsubtended by the minor arc PQ at O is ∠POQ and\\nthe angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is\\nreflex angle POQ.\\nFig. 9.14\\n In view of the property above and Theorem 9.1,\\nthe following result is true:\\nCongruent arcs (or equal arcs) of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.\\nTherefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the\\nangle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem\\ngives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a\\npoint on the circle.\\nTheorem 9.7 : The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle\\nsubtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.\\nProof : Given an arc PQ of a circle subtending angles POQ at the centre O and\\nPAQ at a point A on the remaining part of the circle. We need to prove that\\n∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ.\\nFig. 9.15\\nConsider the three different cases as given in Fig. 9.15. In (i), arc PQ is minor; in (ii),\\narc PQ is a semicircle and in (iii), arc PQ is major.\\nLet us begin by joining AO and extending it to a point B.\\nIn all the cases,\\n∠ BOQ = ∠ OAQ + ∠ AQO\\nbecause an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite\\nangles.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c124\\nMATHEMATICS\\nAlso in ∆ OAQ,\\nOA = OQ\\n(Radii of a circle)\\nTherefore,\\n∠ OAQ = ∠ OQA\\n(Theorem 7.5)\\nThis gives\\n∠ BOQ = 2 ∠ OAQ\\n(1)\\nSimilarly,\\n∠ BOP = 2 ∠ OAP\\n(2)\\nFrom (1) and (2),\\n∠ BOP + ∠ BOQ = 2(∠ OAP + ∠ OAQ)\\nThis is the same as\\n∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ\\n(3)\\nFor the case (iii), where PQ is the major arc, (3) is replaced by\\nreflex angle POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ\\nRemark : Suppose we join points P and Q and\\nform a chord PQ in the above figures. Then\\n∠ PAQ is also called the angle formed in the\\nsegment PAQP.\\nIn Theorem 9.7, A can be any point on the\\nremaining part of the circle. So if you take any\\nother point C on the remaining part of the circle\\n(see Fig. 9.16), you have\\nFig. 9.16\\n∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PCQ = 2 ∠ PAQ\\nTherefore,\\n∠ PCQ = ∠ PAQ.\\nThis proves the following:\\nTheorem 9.8 : Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.\\nAgain let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately. Here ∠PAQ is an angle\\nin the segment, which is a semicircle. Also, ∠ PAQ = 1\\n2  ∠ POQ = 1\\n2  × 180° = 90°.\\nIf you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that\\n∠ PCQ = 90°\\nTherefore, you find another property of the circle as:\\nAngle in a semicircle is a right angle.\\nThe converse of Theorem 9.8 is also true. It can be stated as:\\nTheorem 9.9 : If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two\\nother points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, the\\nfour points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cCIRCLES\\n125\\nYou can see the truth of this result as follows:\\nIn Fig. 9.17, AB is a line segment, which subtends equal angles at two points C and D.',\n",

(Why?)\\nSimilarly, E′ should also coincide with D.\\n9.5 Cyclic Quadrilaterals\\nFig. 9.18\\nA quadrilateral ABCD is called cyclic if all the four vertices\\nof it lie on a circle (see Fig 9.18). You will find a peculiar\\nproperty in such quadrilaterals. Draw several cyclic\\nquadrilaterals of different sides and name each of these\\nas ABCD. (This can be done by drawing several circles\\nof different radii and taking four points on each of them.)\\nMeasure the opposite angles and write your observations\\nin the following table.\\n  S.No. of Quadrilateral\\n∠ A\\n∠ B\\n∠ C\\n∠ D\\n∠ A +∠ C\\n∠ B +∠ D\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\n6.\\nWhat do you infer from the table?\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c126\\nMATHEMATICS\\nYou find that ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°, neglecting the error in\\nmeasurements. This verifies the following:\\nTheorem 9.10 : The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral\\nis 180º.\\nIn fact, the converse of this theorem, which is stated below is also true.\\nTheorem 9.11 : If the sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 180º,\\nthe quadrilateral is cyclic.\\nYou can see the truth of this theorem by following a method similar to the method\\nadopted for Theorem 9.9.\\nExample 2 : In Fig. 9.19, AB is a diameter of the circle, CD is a chord equal to the\\nradius of the circle.

Book I\\ndeals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles,\\ntrapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised\\nquadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of\\ncylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has\\nderived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in\\nterms of its three sides.\\nFig. 10.1\\nThe formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s\\nformula. It is stated as:\\nArea of a triangle =\\n(\\n) (\\n) (\\n)\\ns s\\na\\ns\\nb\\ns\\nc\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n(I)\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c132\\nMATHEMATICS\\nwhere a, b and c are the sides of the triangle, and s = semi-perimeter, i.e., half the\\na\\nb\\nc\\n+\\n+\\n,\\nperimeter of the triangle = \\n2\\nThis formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle\\neasily. Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned\\nabove (see Fig. 10.2).\\nLet us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,\\nso that we have s = 40\\n24\\n32\\n+\\n+\\n m = 48 m.\\n2\\ns – a = (48 – 40) m = 8 m,\\ns – b = (48 – 24) m = 24 m,\\ns – c = (48 – 32) m = 16 m.\\nFig. 10.2\\nTherefore, area of the park ABC\\n=\\n(\\n) (\\n) (\\n)\\n−\\n−\\n−\\ns s\\na\\ns\\nb\\ns\\nc\\n= \\n2\\n2\\n48\\n8\\n24\\n16 m\\n384m\\n×\\n×\\n×\\n=\\nWe see that 322 + 242 = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 402. Therefore, the sides of the park\\nmake a right triangle. The largest side, i.e., BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse\\nand the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90°.\\nWe can check that the area of the park is 1\\n2  × 32 × 24 m2 = 384 m2.\\nWe find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron’s\\nformula.\\nNow using Heron’s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other\\ntriangles discussed earlier viz.,\\n(i) equilateral triangle with side 10 cm.\\n(ii) isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.\\nYou will see that\\nFor (i), we have s = 10\\n10\\n10\\n+\\n+\\n cm = 15 cm.\\n2\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cHERON’S FORMULA\\n133\\nArea of triangle  = 15(15\\n10) (15\\n10) (15\\n10)\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n cm2\\n                         =\\n2\\n2\\n15\\n5\\n5\\n5 cm\\n25 3 cm\\n×\\n×\\n×\\n=\\n+\\n+\\n=\\nFor (ii), we have s = 8\\n5\\n5 cm\\n9 cm\\n2\\nArea of triangle = \\n9(9\\n8) (9\\n5) (9\\n5)\\n−\\n−\\n−\\ncm2 = \\n2\\n2\\n9\\n1\\n4\\n4 cm\\n12 cm .\\n× ×\\n×\\n=\\nLet us now solve some more examples:\\nExample 1 : Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 11 cm and\\nthe perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 10.3).\\nSolution : Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and b = 11 cm.\\nThird side c = 32 cm – (8 + 11) cm = 13 cm\\nSo,\\n2s = 32, i.e., s = 16 cm,\\ns – a = (16 – 8) cm = 8 cm,\\ns – b = (16 – 11) cm = 5 cm,\\ns – c = (16 – 13) cm = 3 cm.\\nFig. 10.3\\nTherefore, area of the triangle =\\n(\\n) (\\n) (\\n)\\ns s\\na\\ns\\nb\\ns\\nc\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n=\\n2\\n2\\n16\\n8\\n5\\n3cm\\n8 30 cm\\n×\\n×\\n×\\n=\\nExample 2 : A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 10.4).

We will now\\nstudy the surface area of cone.\\nSo far, we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally,\\nsuch figures are called prisms. Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a\\nprism (These kinds of solids are called pyramids.). Let us see how we can generate\\nthem.\\nActivity : Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick\\nstring along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 11.1(a)].\\nHold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle\\nabout the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that\\nthe triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 11.1(b)]? Does it remind\\nyou of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that shape [see\\nFig. 11.1 (c) and (d)]?\\nFig. 11.1\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c138\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFig. 11.2\\nThis is called a right circular cone. In Fig. 11.1(c)\\nof the right circular cone, the point A is called the\\nvertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius\\nand AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B\\nwill be the centre of circular base of the cone. The\\nheight, radius and slant height of the cone are usually\\ndenoted by h, r and l respectively. Once again, let us\\nsee what kind of cone we can not call a right circular\\ncone. Here, you are (see Fig. 11.2)! What you see in\\nthese figures are not right circular cones; because in\\n(a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its base\\nis not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the base is\\nnot circular.\\nAs in the case of cylinder, since we will be studying only about right circular cones,\\nremember that by ‘cone’ in this chapter, we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’\\nActivity : (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped\\npaper, straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms\\nthe surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height of\\nthe cone which is represented by l). It looks like a part of a round cake.\\n(ii)\\nIf you now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together, you can see that\\nthe curved portion of Fig. 11.3 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.\\nFig. 11.3\\n(iii) If the paper like the one in Fig. 11.3 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,\\nalong the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,\\nwhose height is the slant height l of the cone.\\n1\\n(iv) Now the area of each triangle = \\n2  × base of each triangle × l.\\nSo, area of the entire piece of paper\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n139\\n= sum of the areas of all the triangles\\n=\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\nbl\\nb l\\nb l\\n+\\n+\\n+ ⋯ = \\n(\\n)\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n2l b\\nb\\nb\\n+\\n+\\n+ ⋯\\n= 1\\n2  × l × length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 11.3(c)\\n(as b1 + b2 + b3 + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)\\nBut the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone\\nand the circumference of the base of the cone = 2πr, where r is the base radius of the\\ncone.\\nSo, Curved Surface Area of a Cone = 1\\n2  × l × 2πππππr = πππππrl\\nwhere r is its base radius and l its slant height.\\nNote that l2 = r2 + h2 (as can be seen from Fig. 11.4), by\\napplying Pythagoras Theorem.

Yes,\\nyou can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant\\ndistance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.\\nNow if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had\\nrotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 11.6). What\\ndoes it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.\\nFig. 11.6\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c142\\nMATHEMATICS\\nCan you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on\\nrotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three\\ndimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space,\\nwhich lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the\\ncentre of the sphere.\\nNote : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the\\nsolid whose surface is a sphere.\\nActivity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone\\nplay with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take\\na rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string\\naround the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep\\nthe string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,\\ntill you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 11.7(a)]. Mark the starting and\\nfinishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.\\nNow, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which\\nyou easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal\\nto the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had\\nwound around the ball [see Fig. 11.7(b)].\\nFig. 11.7\\nWhat have you achieved in all this?\\nThe string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been\\nused to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.\\nSo, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r\\n= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × (π r2)\\nSo,\\nSurface Area of a Sphere = 4 πππππ r2\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n143\\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\\nHow many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere?

First, take two or\\nthree spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of\\nthe spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the\\ncontainer. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 11.13(a)].\\nNow, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from\\nthe container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 11.13(b)].\\nCarefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated\\ncylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 11.13(c)].

       " 'STATISTICS\\n151\\nCHAPTER 12\\nSTATISTICS\\n12.1 Graphical Representation of Data\\nThe representation of data by tables has already been discussed. Now let us turn our\\nattention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well\\nsaid that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the\\nindividual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes\\neasier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical\\nrepresentations in this section.\\n(A) Bar graphs\\n(B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths\\n(C) Frequency polygons\\n(A) Bar Graphs\\nIn earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we\\nshall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a\\npictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with\\nequal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The\\nvalues of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of\\nthe bars depend on the values of the variable.\\nExample 1 : In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the\\nmonths of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c152\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFig. 12.1\\nObserve the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:\\n(i)\\nHow many students were born in the month of November?\\n(ii)\\nIn which month were the maximum number of students born?\\nSolution : Note that the variable here is the ‘month of birth’, and the value of the\\nvariable is the ‘Number of students born’.\\n(i) 4 students were born in the month of November.\\n(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.\\nLet us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.\\nExample 2 : A family with a monthly income of ` 20,000 had planned the following\\nexpenditures per month under various heads:\\nTable 12.1\\nHeads\\nExpenditure\\n(in thousand rupees)\\nGrocery\\n4\\nRent\\n5\\nEducation of children\\n5\\nMedicine\\n2\\nFuel\\n2\\nEntertainment\\n1\\nMiscellaneous\\n1\\nDraw a bar graph for the data above.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n153\\nSolution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit\\nin the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means `4000.\\n1.\\nWe represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,\\nsince the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths\\nfor all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by\\none unit.\\n2.\\nWe represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum\\nexpenditure is `5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = `1000.\\n3.\\nTo represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width\\n1 unit and height 4 units.\\n4.\\nSimilarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two\\nconsecutive bars.\\nThe bar graph is drawn in Fig. 12.2.\\nFig. 12.2\\nHere, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,\\nthe expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,\\nin some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.\\nActivity 1 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by\\nsuitable bar graphs.\\nLet us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals\\ncan be represented graphically.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c154\\nMATHEMATICS\\n(B) Histogram\\nThis is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class\\nintervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 12.2, representing\\nthe weights of 36 students of a class:\\nTable 12.2\\nWeights (in kg)\\nNumber of students\\n30.5 - 35.5\\n9\\n35.5 - 40.5\\n6\\n40.5 - 45.5\\n15\\n45.5 - 50.5\\n3\\n50.5 - 55.5\\n1\\n55.5 - 60.5\\n2\\nTotal\\n36\\nLet us represent the data given above graphically as follows:\\n(i)\\nWe represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose\\nthe scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5\\nand not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.\\n(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable\\nscale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to\\naccomodate this maximum frequency.\\n(iii) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size\\nand lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For\\nexample, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and\\nlength 4.5 cm.\\n(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n155\\nFig. 12.3\\nObserve that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant\\ngraph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical',\n",
       " 'and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For\\nexample, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and\\nlength 4.5 cm.\\n(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 12.3:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n155\\nFig. 12.3\\nObserve that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant\\ngraph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical\\nrepresentation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike\\na bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.\\nHere, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding\\nfrequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of\\nthe rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths\\naccording to (iii) above.\\nNow, consider a situation different from the one above.\\nExample 3 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students\\nin a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a\\nfew students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to\\ngroup them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70,\\n70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c156\\nMATHEMATICS\\nTable 12.3\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\n  0 - 20\\n7\\n20 - 30\\n10\\n30 - 40\\n10\\n40 - 50\\n20\\n50 - 60\\n20\\n60 - 70\\n15\\n     70 - above\\n8\\nTotal\\n90\\nA histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 12.4.\\nFig. 12.4\\nCarefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents\\nthe data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned\\nearlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.\\nEarlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.\\nBut here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n157\\ngive a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval\\n70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.\\nSo, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that\\nthe areas are again proportional to the frequencies.\\nThe steps to be followed are as given below:\\n1.\\nSelect a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the\\nminimum class-size is 10.\\n2.\\nThe lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the\\nclass-size 10.\\nFor instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when\\nthe class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7\\n20 × 10 = 3.5.\\nSimilarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table:\\nTable 12.4\\nMarks\\nFrequency\\nWidth of\\nLength of the rectangle\\nthe class\\n0 - 20\\n7\\n20\\n7\\n20  × 10 = 3.5\\n20 - 30\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n10  × 10 = 10\\n30 - 40\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n10  × 10 = 10\\n40 - 50\\n20\\n10\\n20\\n10  × 10 = 20\\n50 - 60\\n20\\n10\\n20\\n10  × 10 = 20\\n60 - 70\\n15\\n10\\n15\\n10  × 10 = 15\\n70 - 100\\n8\\n30\\n8\\n30  × 10 = 2.67\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c158\\nMATHEMATICS\\nSince we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,\\nwe may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”.\\nSo, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 12.5.\\nFig. 12.5\\n(C) Frequency Polygon\\nThere is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.\\nThis is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by\\nFig. 12.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of\\nthis histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F\\nand G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 12.6).\\nTo complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n159\\nbefore 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,\\nrespectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown\\nin Fig. 12.3. We have shown this in Fig. 12.6.\\nFig. 12.6\\nAlthough, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding\\nthe highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to\\nmake the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why\\nis this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.)\\nNow, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class\\npreceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c160\\nMATHEMATICS\\nExample 4 : Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a\\ntest, given in Table 12.5.\\nTable 12.5\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\n0 - 10\\n5\\n10 - 20\\n10\\n20 - 30\\n4\\n30 - 40\\n6\\n40 - 50\\n7\\n50 - 60\\n3\\n60 - 70\\n2\\n70 - 80\\n2\\n80 - 90\\n3\\n90 - 100\\n9\\nTotal\\n51\\nDraw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.',\n",

Here, the first class is\\n0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative\\ndirection and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end\\npoint, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of\\nthe horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked\\nas A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.\\nThen OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 12.7.\\nFig. 12.7\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n161\\nFrequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing\\nhistograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.\\nThese mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks.\\nTo find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and\\nlower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus,\\nClass-mark = Upper limit + Lower limit\\n2\\nLet us consider an example.\\nExample 5 : In a city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living\\nindex are given in the following table:\\nTable 12.6\\nCost of living index\\nNumber of weeks\\n140 - 150\\n5\\n150 - 160\\n10\\n160 - 170\\n20\\n170 - 180\\n9\\n180 - 190\\n6\\n190 - 200\\n2\\nTotal\\n52\\nDraw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram).\\nSolution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find\\nthe class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160,....\\nFor 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140\\nSo, the class-mark = 150 + 140\\n2\\n = 290\\n2  = 145.\\nContinuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well.\\nSo, the new table obtained is as shown in the following table:\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\x0c162\\nMATHEMATICS\\nTable 12.7\\nClasses\\nClass-marks\\nFrequency\\n140 - 150\\n145\\n5\\n150 - 160\\n155\\n10\\n160 - 170\\n165\\n20\\n170 - 180\\n175\\n9\\n180 - 190\\n185\\n6\\n190 - 200\\n195\\n2\\nTotal\\n52\\nWe can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal\\naxis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points\\nB(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F(185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments.\\nWe should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class\\n130 - 140 (just before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is,\\nA(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2).

       " '208\\nMATHEMATICS\\nCHAPTER 13\\nSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n13.1 Introduction\\nWherever we look, usually we see solids. So far, in all our study, we have been dealing\\nwith figures that can be easily drawn on our notebooks or blackboards. These are\\ncalled plane figures. We have understood what rectangles, squares and circles are,\\nwhat we mean by their perimeters and areas, and how we can find them. We have\\nlearnt these in earlier classes. It would be interesting to see what happens if we cut\\nout many of these plane figures of the same shape and size from cardboard sheet and\\nstack them up in a vertical pile. By this process, we shall obtain some solid figures\\n(briefly called solids) such as a cuboid, a cylinder, etc. In the earlier classes, you have\\nalso learnt to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids, cubes and cylinders. We\\nshall now learn to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids and cylinders in\\ndetails and extend this study to some other solids such as cones and spheres.\\n13.2 Surface Area of a Cuboid and a Cube\\nHave you looked at a bundle of many sheets of paper? How does it look? Does it look\\nlike what you see in Fig. 13.1?\\nFig. 13.1\\nThat makes up a cuboid. How much of brown paper would you need, if you want\\nto cover this cuboid? Let us see:\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n209\\nFirst we would need a rectangular piece to cover\\nthe bottom of the bundle. That would be as shown in\\nFig. 13.2 (a)\\nThen we would need two long rectangular pieces\\nto cover the two side ends. Now, it would look like\\nFig. 13.2 (b).\\nNow to cover the front and back ends, we would\\nneed two more rectangular pieces of a different size.\\nWith them, we would now have a figure as shown in\\nFig. 13.2(c).\\nThis figure, when opened out, would look like\\nFig. 13.2 (d).\\nFinally, to cover the top of the bundle, we would\\nrequire another rectangular piece exactly like the one\\nat the bottom, which if we attach on the right side, it\\nwould look like Fig. 13.2(e).\\nSo we have used six rectangular pieces to cover\\nthe complete outer surface of the cuboid.\\nFig. 13.2\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c210\\nMATHEMATICS\\nThis shows us that the outer surface of a cuboid is made up of six rectangles (in\\nfact, rectangular regions, called the faces of the cuboid), whose areas can be found by\\nmultiplying length by breadth for each of them separately  and then adding the six\\nareas together.\\nNow, if we take the length of the cuboid as l, breadth as b and the height as h, then\\nthe figure with these dimensions would be like the shape you see in Fig. 13.2(f).\\nSo, the sum of the areas of the six rectangles is:\\nArea of rectangle 1 (= l × h)\\n+\\nArea of rectangle 2 (= l × b)\\n+\\nArea of rectangle 3 (= l × h)\\n+\\nArea of rectangle 4 (= l × b)\\n+\\nArea of rectangle 5 (= b × h)\\n+\\nArea of rectangle 6 (= b × h)\\n= 2(l × b) + 2(b × h) + 2(l × h)\\n= 2(lb + bh + hl)\\nThis gives us:\\nSurface Area of a Cuboid = 2(lb + bh + hl)\\nwhere l, b and h are respectively the three edges of the cuboid.\\nNote : The unit of area is taken as the square unit, because we measure the magnitude\\nof a region by filling it with squares of side of unit length.\\nFor example, if we have a cuboid whose length, breadth and height are 15 cm,\\n10 cm and 20 cm respectively, then its surface area would be:\\n2[(15 × 10) + (10 × 20) + (20 × 15)] cm2\\n= 2(150 + 200 + 300) cm2\\n= 2 × 650 cm2\\n= 1300 cm2\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n211\\nRecall that a cuboid, whose length, breadth and height are all equal, is called a\\ncube. If each edge of the cube is a, then the surface area of this cube would be\\n2(a × a + a × a + a × a), i.e., 6a2 (see Fig. 13.3), giving us\\nSurface Area of a Cube = 6a2\\nwhere a is the edge of the cube.\\nFig. 13.3\\nSuppose, out of the six faces of a cuboid, we only find the area of the four faces,\\nleaving the bottom and top faces. In such a case, the area of these four faces is called\\nthe lateral surface area of the cuboid. So, lateral surface area of a cuboid of\\nlength l, breadth b and height h is equal to 2lh + 2bh or 2(l + b)h. Similarly,\\nlateral surface area of a cube of side a is equal to 4a2.\\nKeeping in view of the above, the surface area of a cuboid (or a cube) is sometimes\\nalso referred to as the total surface area. Let us now solve some examples.\\nExample 1 : Mary wants to decorate her Christmas\\ntree. She wants to place the tree on a wooden box\\ncovered with coloured paper with picture of Santa\\nClaus on it (see Fig. 13.4). She must know the exact\\nquantity of paper to buy for this purpose. If the box\\nhas length, breadth and height as 80 cm, 40 cm and\\n20 cm respectively how many square sheets of paper\\nof side 40 cm would she require?\\nFig. 13.4\\nSolution : Since Mary wants to paste the paper on\\nthe outer surface of the box; the quantity of paper\\nrequired would be equal to the surface area of the\\nbox which is of the shape of a cuboid. The dimensions\\nof the box are:\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c212\\nMATHEMATICS\\nLength =80 cm, Breadth = 40 cm, Height = 20 cm.\\nThe surface area of the box = 2(lb + bh + hl)\\n= 2[(80 × 40) + (40 × 20) + (20 × 80)] cm2',\n",
       " '20 cm respectively how many square sheets of paper\\nof side 40 cm would she require?\\nFig. 13.4\\nSolution : Since Mary wants to paste the paper on\\nthe outer surface of the box; the quantity of paper\\nrequired would be equal to the surface area of the\\nbox which is of the shape of a cuboid. The dimensions\\nof the box are:\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c212\\nMATHEMATICS\\nLength =80 cm, Breadth = 40 cm, Height = 20 cm.\\nThe surface area of the box = 2(lb + bh + hl)\\n= 2[(80 × 40) + (40 × 20) + (20 × 80)] cm2\\n= 2[3200 + 800 + 1600] cm2\\n= 2 × 5600 cm2 = 11200 cm2\\nThe area of each sheet of the paper = 40 × 40 cm2\\n                                                     = 1600 cm2\\nTherefore, number of sheets required = \\nsurface area of box\\narea of one sheet of paper\\n= 11200\\n1600  = 7\\nSo, she would require 7 sheets.\\nExample 2 : Hameed has built a cubical water tank with lid for his house, with each\\nouter edge 1.5 m long. He gets the outer surface of the tank excluding the base,\\ncovered with square tiles of side 25 cm (see Fig. 13.5). Find how much he would\\nspend for the tiles, if the cost of the tiles is ` 360 per dozen.\\nSolution : Since Hameed is getting the five outer faces of the tank covered with tiles,\\nhe would need to know the surface area of the tank, to decide on the number of tiles\\nrequired.\\nEdge of the cubical tank = 1.5 m = 150 cm (= a)\\nSo,\\nsurface area of the tank = 5 × 150 × 150 cm2\\nArea of each square tile = side × side = 25 × 25 cm2\\nSo, the number of tiles required = surface area of the tank\\narea of each tile\\n= 5 ×150 ×150\\nFig. 13.5\\n25 × 25\\n = 180\\nCost of 1 dozen tiles, i.e., cost of 12 tiles = ` 360\\nTherefore, cost of one tile = ` 360\\n12  = ` 30\\nSo, the cost of 180 tiles = 180 × ` 30 = ` 5400\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n213\\nEXERCISE 13.1\\n1.\\nA plastic box 1.5 m long, 1.25 m wide and 65 cm deep is to be made.

Let\\nus see what kind of cylinder is not a right circular cylinder.\\nIn Fig 13.7 (a), you see a cylinder, which\\nis certainly circular, but it is not at right angles\\nto the base. So, we can not say this a right\\ncircular cylinder.\\nOf course, if we have a cylinder with a\\nnon circular base, as you see in Fig. 13.7 (b),\\nthen we also cannot call it a right circular\\ncylinder.\\nFig. 13.7\\nRemark : Here, we will be dealing with only right circular cylinders. So, unless stated\\notherwise, the word cylinder would mean a right circular cylinder.\\nNow, if a cylinder is to be covered with coloured paper, how will we do it with the',\n",

So, we can not say this a right\\ncircular cylinder.\\nOf course, if we have a cylinder with a\\nnon circular base, as you see in Fig. 13.7 (b),\\nthen we also cannot call it a right circular\\ncylinder.\\nFig. 13.7\\nRemark : Here, we will be dealing with only right circular cylinders. So, unless stated\\notherwise, the word cylinder would mean a right circular cylinder.\\nNow, if a cylinder is to be covered with coloured paper, how will we do it with the\\nminimum amount of paper? First take a rectangular sheet of paper, whose length is\\njust enough to go round the cylinder and whose breadth is equal to the height of the\\ncylinder as shown in Fig. 13.8.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n215\\nl\\nFig. 13.8\\nThe area of the sheet gives us the curved surface area of the cylinder. Note that\\nthe length of the sheet is equal to the circumference of the circular base which is equal\\nto 2πr.\\nSo, curved surface area of the cylinder\\n= area of the rectangular sheet = length × breadth\\n= perimeter of the base of the cylinder × h\\n= 2πr × h\\nTherefore, Curved Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πππππrh\\nwhere r is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.\\nRemark : In the case of a cylinder, unless stated\\notherwise, ‘radius of a cylinder’ shall mean’ base radius\\nof the cylinder’.\\nIf the top and the bottom of the cylinder are also to\\nbe covered, then we need two circles (infact, circular\\nregions) to do that, each of radius r, and thus having an\\narea of πr2 each (see Fig. 13.9), giving us the total\\nsurface area as 2πrh + 2πr2 = 2πr(r + h).\\nSo,\\nTotal Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πππππr(r + h)\\nFig. 13.9\\nwhere h is the height of the cylinder and r its radius.\\nRemark : You may recall from Chapter 1 that π is an irrational number. So, the value\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c216\\nMATHEMATICS\\nof π is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal. But when we use its value in our\\ncalculations, we usually take its value as approximately equal to 22\\n7  or 3.14.\\nExample 3 : Savitri had to make a model of a cylindrical kaleidoscope for her science\\nproject.

Once again, let us\\nsee what kind of cone we can not call a right circular\\ncone. Here, you are (see Fig. 13.14)! What you see\\nin these figures are not right circular cones; because\\nin (a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its\\nbase is not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the\\nbase is not circular.\\nAs in the case of cylinder, since we will be studying only about right circular cones,\\nremember that by ‘cone’ in this chapter, we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’\\nActivity : (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped\\npaper, straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms\\nthe surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height of\\nthe cone which is represented by l).

Yes,\\nyou can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant\\ndistance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.\\nNow if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had\\nrotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 13.18). What\\ndoes it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.\\nFig. 13.18\\nCan you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on\\nrotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three\\ndimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space,\\nwhich lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the\\ncentre of the sphere.\\nNote : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the\\nsolid whose surface is a sphere.\\nActivity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone\\nplay with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take\\na rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string\\naround the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep\\nthe string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,\\ntill you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 13.19(a)]. Mark the starting and\\nfinishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.\\nNow, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which\\nyou easily get its radius.

This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r\\n= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × (π r2)\\nSo,\\nSurface Area of a Sphere = 4 πππππ r2\\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\\nHow many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is\\ncurved.\\nNow, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through\\nthe middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What\\nhappens to the sphere?\\nFig. 13.20\\nYes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 13.20)!\\nWhat will each half  be called? It is called a hemisphere.\\n(Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’)\\nAnd what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?\\nTwo!

If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost\\nof painting it, given the cost of painting is ` 5 per 100 cm2.\\nSolution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need\\nto find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that\\nneeds to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m.

       " 'Recall that solid objects occupy space. The measure of this occupied space is called\\nthe Volume of the object.\\nNote : If an object is solid, then the space occupied by such an object is measured,\\nand is termed the Volume of the object. On the other hand, if the object is hollow, then\\ninterior is empty, and can be filled with air, or some liquid that will take the shape of its\\ncontainer. In this case, the volume of the substance that can fill the interior is called the\\ncapacity of the container. In short, the volume of an object is the measure of the\\nspace it occupies, and the capacity of an object is the volume of substance its interior\\ncan accommodate. Hence, the unit of measurement of either of the two is cubic unit.\\nSo, if we were to talk of the volume of a cuboid, we would be considering the\\nmeasure of the space occupied by the cuboid.\\nFurther, the area or the volume is measured as the magnitude of a region. So,\\ncorrectly speaking, we should be finding the area of a circular region, or volume of a\\ncuboidal region, or volume of a spherical region, etc. But for the sake of simplicity, we\\nsay, find the area of a circle, volume of a cuboid or a sphere even though these mean\\nonly their boundaries.\\nFig. 13.23\\nObserve Fig. 13.23. Suppose we say that the area of each rectangle is A, the\\nheight up to which the rectangles are stacked is h and the volume of the cuboid is V.\\nCan you tell what would be the relationship between V, A and h?\\nThe area of the plane region occupied by each rectangle × height\\n= Measure of the space occupied by the cuboid\\nSo, we get\\nA × h = V\\nThat is, Volume of a Cuboid = base area × height = length × breadth × height\\nor l × b × h, where l, b and h are respectively the length, breadth and height of the\\ncuboid.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES\\n227\\nNote : When we measure the magnitude of the region of a space, that is, the\\nspace occupied by a solid, we do so by counting the number of cubes of edge of unit\\nlength that can fit into it exactly. Therefore, the unit of measurement of volume is\\ncubic unit.\\nAgain\\nVolume of a Cube = edge × edge × edge = a3\\nwhere a is the edge of the cube (see Fig. 13.24).\\nSo, if a cube has edge of 12 cm,\\nthen volume of the cube = 12 × 12 × 12 cm3\\n                             = 1728 cm3.\\nRecall that you have learnt these formulae in\\nearlier classes.

The height\\nof the wall is 4 m and thickness of the wall is 24 cm. If this wall is to be built up with\\nbricks whose dimensions are 24 cm × 12 cm × 8 cm, how many bricks would be\\nrequired?\\nSolution : Since the wall with all its bricks makes up the space occupied by it, we\\nneed to find the volume of the wall, which is nothing but a cuboid.\\nHere,\\nLength = 10 m = 1000 cm\\nThickness = 24 cm\\nHeight = 4 m = 400 cm\\nTherefore,\\nVolume of the wall = length × thickness × height\\n= 1000 × 24 × 400 cm3\\nNow, each brick is a cuboid with length = 24 cm, breadth = 12 cm and height = 8 cm\\nSo, volume of each brick = length × breadth × height\\n                                     = 24 × 12 × 8 cm3\\nSo, number of bricks required =\\nvolume of the wall\\nvolume of each brick\\n= 1000 × 24 × 400\\n24 ×12 × 8\\n= 4166.6\\nSo, the wall requires 4167 bricks.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c228\\nMATHEMATICS\\nExample 12 : A child playing with building blocks, which are\\nof the shape of cubes, has built a structure as shown in\\nFig. 13.25.

We find\\nthat it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 13.29(a)].\\nWhen we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see\\nthat the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 13.29(b)].\\nWhen the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be\\nseen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 13.29(c)].\\nWith this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a\\ncone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the\\nsame height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the\\nvolume of the cylinder.\\nSo,\\nVolume of a Cone = 1\\n3 πππππr2h\\nwhere r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone.\\nExample 15 : The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm\\nrespectively.

First, take two or\\nthree spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of\\nthe spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the\\ncontainer. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 13.30(a)].\\nNow, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from\\nthe container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 13.30(b)].\\nCarefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated\\ncylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 13.30(c)]. Suppose the\\nradius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter\\nof the sphere). Then evaluate 4\\n3  πr3. Do you find this value almost equal to the\\nmeasure of the volume over flowed?\\nFig. 13.30',\n",

These may relate to cricket batting or bowling averages,\\nprofits of a company, temperatures of cities, expenditures in various sectors of a five\\nyear plan, polling results, and so on. These facts or figures, which are numerical or\\notherwise, collected with a definite purpose are called data. Data is the plural form of\\nthe Latin word datum. Of course, the word ‘data’ is not new for you. You have\\nstudied about data and data handling in earlier classes.\\nOur world is becoming more and more information oriented. Every part of our\\nlives utilises data in one form or the other. So, it becomes essential for us to know how\\nto extract meaningful information from such data. This  extraction of meaningful\\ninformation is studied in a branch of mathematics called Statistics.\\nThe word ‘statistics’ appears to have been derived from the Latin word ‘status’\\nmeaning ‘a (political) state’. In its origin, statistics was simply the collection of data on\\ndifferent aspects of the life of people, useful to the State. Over the period of time,\\nhowever, its scope broadened and statistics began to concern itself not only with the\\ncollection and presentation of data but also with the interpretation and drawing of\\ninferences from the data. Statistics deals with collection, organisation, analysis and\\ninterpretation of data. The word ‘statistics’ has different meanings in different contexts.\\nLet us observe the following sentences:\\n1. May I have the latest copy of ‘Educational Statistics of India’.\\n2. I like to study ‘Statistics’ because it is used in day-to-day life.\\nIn the first sentence, statistics is used in a plural sense, meaning numerical data. These\\nmay include a number of educational institutions of India, literacy rates of various\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n239\\nstates, etc. In the second sentence, the word ‘statistics’ is used as a singular noun,\\nmeaning the subject which deals with the collection, presentation, analysis of data as\\nwell as drawing of meaningful conclusions from the data.\\nIn this chapter, we shall briefly discuss all these aspects regarding data.\\n14.2 Collection of Data\\nLet us begin with an exercise on gathering data by performing the following activity.\\nActivity 1 : Divide the students of your class into four groups. Allot each group the\\nwork of collecting one of the following kinds of data:\\n(i) Heights of 20 students of your class.\\n(ii) Number of absentees in each day in your class for a month.\\n(iii) Number of members in the families of your classmates.\\n(iv) Heights of 15 plants in or around your school.\\nLet us move to the results students have gathered. How did they collect their data\\nin each group?\\n(i) Did they collect the information from each and every student, house or person\\nconcerned for obtaining the information?\\n(ii) Did they get the information from some source like available school records?\\nIn the first case, when the information was collected by the investigator herself or\\nhimself with a definite objective in her or his mind, the data obtained is called primary\\ndata.\\nIn the second case, when the information was gathered from a source which\\nalready had the information  stored, the data obtained is called secondary data. Such\\ndata, which has been collected by someone else in another context, needs to be used\\nwith great care ensuring that the source is reliable.\\nBy now, you must have understood how to collect data and distinguish between\\nprimary and secondary data.\\nEXERCISE 14.1\\n1.\\nGive five examples of data that you can collect from your day-to-day life.\\n2.\\nClassify the data in Q.1 above as primary or secondary data.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c240\\nMATHEMATICS\\n14.3 Presentation of Data\\nAs soon as the work related to collection of data is over, the investigator has to find out\\nways to present them in a form which is meaningful, easily understood and gives its\\nmain features at a glance. Let us now recall the various ways of presenting the data\\nthrough some examples.\\nExample 1 : Consider the marks obtained by 10 students in a mathematics test as\\ngiven below:\\n55\\n36\\n95\\n73\\n60\\n42\\n25\\n78\\n75\\n62\\nThe data in this form is called raw data.\\nBy looking at it in this form, can you find the highest and the lowest marks?\\nDid it take you some time to search for the maximum and minimum scores? Wouldn’t\\nit be less time consuming if these scores were arranged in ascending or descending\\norder? So let us arrange the marks in ascending order as\\n25\\n36\\n42\\n55\\n60\\n62\\n73\\n75\\n78\\n95\\nNow, we can clearly see that the lowest marks are 25 and the highest marks are 95.\\nThe difference of the highest and the lowest values in the data is called the range of the\\ndata. So, the range in this case is 95 – 25 = 70.\\nPresentation of data in ascending or descending order can be quite time consuming,',\n",

So, the range in this case is 95 – 25 = 70.\\nPresentation of data in ascending or descending order can be quite time consuming,\\nparticularly when the number of observations in an experiment is large, as in the case\\nof the next example.\\nExample 2 : Consider the marks obtained (out of 100 marks) by 30 students of Class\\nIX of a school:\\n10\\n20\\n36\\n92\\n95\\n40\\n50\\n56\\n60\\n70\\n92\\n88\\n80\\n70\\n72\\n70\\n36\\n40\\n36\\n40\\n92\\n40\\n50\\n50\\n56\\n60\\n70\\n60\\n60\\n88\\nRecall that the number of students who have obtained a certain number of marks is\\ncalled the frequency of those marks. For instance, 4 students got 70 marks. So the\\nfrequency of 70 marks is 4. To make the data more easily understandable, we write it\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n241\\nin a table, as given below:\\nTable 14.1\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\n(i.e., the frequency)\\n10\\n1\\n20\\n1\\n36\\n3\\n40\\n4\\n50\\n3\\n56\\n2\\n60\\n4\\n70\\n4\\n72\\n1\\n80\\n1\\n88\\n2\\n92\\n3\\n95\\n1\\nTotal\\n30\\nTable 14.1 is called an ungrouped frequency distribution table, or simply a frequency\\ndistribution table. Note that you can use also tally marks in preparing these tables,\\nas in the next example.\\nExample 3 : 100 plants each were planted in 100 schools during Van Mahotsava.\\nAfter one month, the number of plants that survived were recorded as :\\n95\\n67\\n28\\n32\\n65\\n65\\n69\\n33\\n98\\n96\\n76\\n42\\n32\\n38\\n42\\n40\\n40\\n69\\n95\\n92\\n75\\n83\\n76\\n83\\n85\\n62\\n37\\n65\\n63\\n42\\n89\\n65\\n73\\n81\\n49\\n52\\n64\\n76\\n83\\n92\\n93\\n68\\n52\\n79\\n81\\n83\\n59\\n82\\n75\\n82\\n86\\n90\\n44\\n62\\n31\\n36\\n38\\n42\\n39\\n83\\n87\\n56\\n58\\n23\\n35\\n76\\n83\\n85\\n30\\n68\\n69\\n83\\n86\\n43\\n45\\n39\\n83\\n75\\n66\\n83\\n92\\n75\\n89\\n66\\n91\\n27\\n88\\n89\\n93\\n42\\n53\\n69\\n90\\n55\\n66\\n49\\n52\\n83\\n34\\n36\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c242\\nMATHEMATICS\\nTo present such a large amount of data so that a reader can make sense of it easily,\\nwe condense it into groups like 20-29, 30-39, . . ., 90-99 (since our data is from\\n23 to 98). These groupings are called ‘classes’ or ‘class-intervals’, and their size is\\ncalled the class-size or class width, which is 10 in this case. In each of these classes,\\nthe least number is called the lower class limit and the greatest number is called the\\nupper class limit, e.g., in 20-29, 20 is the ‘lower class limit’ and 29 is the ‘upper class\\nlimit’.\\nAlso, recall that using tally marks, the data above can be condensed in tabular\\nform as follows:\\nTable 14.2\\nNumber of plants\\nTally Marks\\nNumber of schools\\nsurvived\\n(frequency)\\n20 - 29\\n|||\\n3\\n30 - 39\\n|||| |||| ||||\\n14\\n40 - 49\\n|||| |||| ||\\n12\\n50 - 59\\n|||| |||\\n8\\n60 - 69\\n|||| |||| |||| |||\\n18\\n70 - 79\\n|||| ||||\\n10\\n80 - 89\\n|||| |||| |||| |||| |||\\n23\\n90 - 99\\n|||| |||| ||\\n12\\nTotal\\n100\\nPresenting data in this form simplifies and condenses data and enables us to observe\\ncertain important features at a glance. This is called a grouped frequency distribution\\ntable. Here we can easily observe that 50% or more plants survived in 8 + 18 + 10 +\\n23 + 12 = 71 schools.\\nWe observe that the classes in the table above are non-overlapping. Note that we\\ncould have made more classes of shorter size, or fewer classes of larger size also. For\\ninstance, the intervals could have been 22-26, 27-31, and so on. So, there is no hard\\nand fast rule about this except that the classes should not overlap.\\nExample 4 : Let us now consider the following frequency distribution table which\\ngives the weights of 38 students of a class:\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n243\\nTable 14.3\\nWeights (in kg)\\nNumber of students\\n31 - 35\\n9\\n36 - 40\\n5\\n41 - 45\\n14\\n46 - 50\\n3\\n51 - 55\\n1\\n56 - 60\\n2\\n61 - 65\\n2\\n66 - 70\\n1\\n71 - 75\\n1\\nTotal\\n38\\nNow, if two new students of weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg are admitted in this class,\\nthen in which interval will we include them? We cannot add them in the ones ending\\nwith 35 or 40, nor to the following ones. This is because there are gaps in between the\\nupper and lower limits of two consecutive classes. So, we need to divide the intervals\\nso that the upper and lower limits of consecutive intervals are the same. For this, we\\nfind the difference between the upper limit of a class and the lower limit of its succeeding\\nclass. We then add half of this difference to each of the upper limits and subtract the\\nsame from each of the lower limits.\\nFor example, consider the classes 31 - 35 and 36 - 40.\\nThe lower limit of 36 - 40 = 36\\nThe upper limit of 31 - 35 = 35\\nThe difference = 36 – 35 = 1\\nSo,\\nhalf the difference = 1\\n2  = 0.5\\nSo the new class interval formed from 31 - 35 is (31 – 0.5) - (35 + 0.5), i.e., 30.5 - 35.5.\\nSimilarly, the new class formed from the class 36 - 40 is (36 – 0.5) - (40 + 0.5), i.e.,\\n35.5 - 40.5.\\nContinuing in the same manner, the continuous classes formed are:\\n30.5-35.5, 35.5-40.5, 40.5-45.5, 45.5-50.5, 50.5-55.5, 55.5-60.5,\\n60.5 - 65.5, 65.5 - 70.5, 70.5 - 75.5.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c244\\nMATHEMATICS\\nNow it is possible for us to include the weights of the new students in these classes.',\n",

In which class do you think this weight should be considered?\\nIf it is considered in both classes, it will be counted twice.\\nBy convention, we consider 35.5 in the class 35.5 - 40.5 and not in 30.5 - 35.5.\\nSimilarly, 40.5 is considered in 40.5 - 45.5 and not  in 35.5 - 40.5.\\nSo, the new weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg would be included in 35.5 - 40.5 and\\n40.5 - 45.5, respectively.

Now let us turn our\\nattention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well\\nsaid that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the\\nindividual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes\\neasier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical\\nrepresentations in this section.\\n(A) Bar graphs\\n(B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths\\n(C) Frequency polygons\\n(A) Bar Graphs\\nIn earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we\\nshall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a\\npictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with\\nequal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The\\nvalues of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of\\nthe bars depend on the values of the variable.\\nExample 5 : In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the\\nmonths of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:\\nFig. 14.1\\nObserve the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:\\n(i)\\nHow many students were born in the month of November?\\n(ii)\\nIn which month were the maximum number of students born?\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c248\\nMATHEMATICS\\nSolution : Note that the variable here is the ‘month of birth’, and the value of the\\nvariable is the ‘Number of students born’.\\n(i) 4 students were born in the month of November.\\n(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.\\nLet us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.\\nExample 6 : A family with a monthly income of ` 20,000 had planned the following\\nexpenditures per month under various heads:\\nTable 14.5\\nHeads\\nExpenditure\\n(in thousand rupees)\\nGrocery\\n4\\nRent\\n5\\nEducation of children\\n5\\nMedicine\\n2\\nFuel\\n2\\nEntertainment\\n1\\nMiscellaneous\\n1\\nDraw a bar graph for the data above.\\nSolution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit\\nin the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means `4000.\\n1.\\nWe represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,\\nsince the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths\\nfor all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by\\none unit.\\n2.\\nWe represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum\\nexpenditure is `5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = `1000.\\n3.\\nTo represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width\\n1 unit and height 4 units.\\n4.\\nSimilarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two\\nconsecutive bars.\\nThe bar graph is drawn in Fig. 14.2.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n249\\nFig. 14.2\\nHere, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,\\nthe expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,\\nin some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.\\nActivity 3 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by\\nsuitable bar graphs.\\nLet us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals\\ncan be represented graphically.\\n(B) Histogram\\nThis is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class\\nintervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 14.6, representing\\nthe weights of 36 students of a class:\\nTable 14.6\\nWeights (in kg)\\nNumber of students\\n30.5 - 35.5\\n9\\n35.5 - 40.5\\n6\\n40.5 - 45.5\\n15\\n45.5 - 50.5\\n3\\n50.5 - 55.5\\n1\\n55.5 - 60.5\\n2\\nTotal\\n36\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c250\\nMATHEMATICS\\nLet us represent the data given above graphically as follows:\\n(i)\\nWe represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose\\nthe scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5\\nand not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.\\n(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable',\n",
       " '6\\n40.5 - 45.5\\n15\\n45.5 - 50.5\\n3\\n50.5 - 55.5\\n1\\n55.5 - 60.5\\n2\\nTotal\\n36\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c250\\nMATHEMATICS\\nLet us represent the data given above graphically as follows:\\n(i)\\nWe represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose\\nthe scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5\\nand not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.\\n(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable\\nscale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to\\naccomodate this maximum frequency.\\n(iii) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size\\nand lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For\\nexample, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and\\nlength 4.5 cm.\\n(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 14.3:\\nFig. 14.3\\nObserve that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant\\ngraph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical\\nrepresentation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike\\na bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.\\nHere, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding\\nfrequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of\\nthe rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths\\naccording to (iii) above.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n251\\nNow, consider a situation different from the one above.\\nExample 7 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students\\nin a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a\\nfew students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to\\ngroup them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70,\\n70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:\\nTable 14.7\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\n  0 - 20\\n7\\n20 - 30\\n10\\n30 - 40\\n10\\n40 - 50\\n20\\n50 - 60\\n20\\n60 - 70\\n15\\n     70 - above\\n8\\nTotal\\n90\\nA histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 14.4.\\nFig. 14.4\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c252\\nMATHEMATICS\\nCarefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents\\nthe data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned\\nearlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.\\nEarlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.\\nBut here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not\\ngive a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval\\n70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.\\nSo, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that\\nthe areas are again proportional to the frequencies.\\nThe steps to be followed are as given below:\\n1.\\nSelect a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the\\nminimum class-size is 10.\\n2.\\nThe lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the\\nclass-size 10.\\nFor instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when\\nthe class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7\\n20 ×10 = 3.5.\\nSimilarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table:\\nTable 14.8\\nMarks\\nFrequency\\nWidth of\\nLength of the rectangle\\nthe class\\n0 - 20\\n7\\n20\\n7\\n20  × 10 = 3.5\\n20 - 30\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n10  × 10 = 10\\n30 - 40\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n10  × 10 = 10\\n40 - 50\\n20\\n10\\n20\\n10  × 10 = 20\\n50 - 60\\n20\\n10\\n20\\n10  × 10 = 20\\n60 - 70\\n15\\n10\\n15\\n10  × 10 = 15\\n70 - 100\\n8\\n30\\n8\\n30  × 10 = 2.67\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n253\\nSince we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,\\nwe may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”.\\nSo, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 14.5.\\nFig. 14.5\\n(C) Frequency Polygon\\nThere is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.\\nThis is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by\\nFig. 14.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of\\nthis histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F\\nand G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 14.6).\\nTo complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero\\nbefore 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,\\nrespectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown\\nin Fig. 14.3. We have shown this in Fig. 14.6.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c254\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFig. 14.6\\nAlthough, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding\\nthe highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to',\n",

Why\\nis this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.)\\nNow, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class\\npreceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.\\nExample 8 : Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a\\ntest, given in Table 14.9.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n255\\nTable 14.9\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\n0 - 10\\n5\\n10 - 20\\n10\\n20 - 30\\n4\\n30 - 40\\n6\\n40 - 50\\n7\\n50 - 60\\n3\\n60 - 70\\n2\\n70 - 80\\n2\\n80 - 90\\n3\\n90 - 100\\n9\\nTotal\\n51\\nDraw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.\\nSolution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the\\ntops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is\\n0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative\\ndirection and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end\\npoint, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of\\nthe horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked\\nas A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.\\nThen OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 14.7.\\nFig. 14.7\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c256\\nMATHEMATICS\\nFrequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing\\nhistograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.\\nThese mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks.\\nTo find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and\\nlower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus,\\nClass-mark = Upper limit + Lower limit\\n2\\nLet us consider an example.\\nExample 9 : In a city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living\\nindex are given in the following table:\\nTable 14.10\\nCost of living index\\nNumber of weeks\\n140 - 150\\n5\\n150 - 160\\n10\\n160 - 170\\n20\\n170 - 180\\n9\\n180 - 190\\n6\\n190 - 200\\n2\\nTotal\\n52\\nDraw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram).\\nSolution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find\\nthe class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160,....\\nFor 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140\\nSo, the class-mark = 150 + 140\\n2\\n = 290\\n2  = 145.\\nContinuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n257\\nSo, the new table obtained is as shown in the following table:\\nTable 14.11\\nClasses\\nClass-marks\\nFrequency\\n140 - 150\\n145\\n5\\n150 - 160\\n155\\n10\\n160 - 170\\n165\\n20\\n170 - 180\\n175\\n9\\n180 - 190\\n185\\n6\\n190 - 200\\n195\\n2\\nTotal\\n52\\nWe can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal\\naxis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points\\nB(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F(185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments.\\nWe should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class\\n130 - 140 (just before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is,\\nA(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2).

Now, the question\\narises if we always need to study all the data to ‘make sense’ of it, or if we can make\\nout some important features of it by considering only certain representatives of the\\ndata. This is possible, by using measures of central tendency or averages.\\nConsider a situation when two students Mary and Hari received their test copies.\\nThe test had five questions, each carrying ten marks. Their scores were as follows:\\nQuestion Numbers\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nMary’s score\\n10\\n8\\n9\\n8\\n7\\nHari’s score\\n4\\n7\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c262\\nMATHEMATICS\\nUpon getting the test copies, both of them found their average scores as follows:\\nMary’s average score = 42\\n5  = 8.4\\nHari’s average score = 41\\n5  = 8.2\\nSince Mary’s average score was more than Hari’s, Mary claimed to have performed\\nbetter than Hari, but Hari did not agree. He arranged both their scores in ascending\\norder and found out the middle score as given below:\\nMary’s Score\\n7\\n8\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nHari’s Score\\n4\\n7\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n Hari said that since his middle-most score was 10, which was higher than Mary’s\\nmiddle-most score, that is 8, his performance should be rated better.\\nBut Mary was not convinced. To convince Mary, Hari tried out another strategy.\\nHe said he had scored 10 marks more often (3 times) as compared to Mary who\\nscored 10 marks only once. So, his performance was better.\\nNow, to settle the dispute between Hari and Mary, let us see the three measures\\nthey adopted to make their point.',\n",

To convince Mary, Hari tried out another strategy.\\nHe said he had scored 10 marks more often (3 times) as compared to Mary who\\nscored 10 marks only once. So, his performance was better.\\nNow, to settle the dispute between Hari and Mary, let us see the three measures\\nthey adopted to make their point.\\nThe average score that Mary found in the first case is the mean. The ‘middle’\\nscore that Hari was using for his argument is the median. The most often scored mark\\nthat Hari used in his second strategy is the mode.\\nNow, let us first look at the mean in detail.\\nThe mean (or average) of a number of observations is the sum of the values of\\nall the observations divided by the total number of observations.\\nIt is denoted by the symbol x , read as ‘x bar’.\\nLet us consider an example.\\nExample 10 : 5 people were asked about the time in a week they spend in doing\\nsocial work in their community. They said 10, 7, 13, 20 and 15 hours, respectively.\\nFind the mean (or average) time in a week devoted by them for social work.\\nSolution : We have already studied in our earlier classes that the mean of a certain\\nnumber of observations is equal to Sum of all the observations\\n. To simplify our\\nTotal number of observations\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n263\\nworking of finding the mean, let us use a variable xi to denote the ith observation. In\\nthis case, i can take the values from 1 to 5. So our first observation is x1, second\\nobservation is x2, and so on till x5.\\nAlso x1 = 10 means that the value of the first observation, denoted by x1, is 10.\\nSimilarly, x2 = 7, x3 = 13, x4 = 20 and x5 = 15.\\nTherefore, the mean x  =\\nSum of all the observations\\nTotal number of observations\\nx\\nx\\nx\\nx\\nx\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n=\\n5\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n = 65\\n= 10\\n7\\n13\\n20\\n15\\n5  = 13\\n5\\nSo, the mean time spent by these 5 people in doing social work is 13 hours in a week.\\nNow, in case we are finding the mean time spent by 30 people in doing social\\nwork, writing x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + x30 would be a tedious job.We use the Greek symbol\\nΣ (for the letter Sigma) for summation. Instead of writing x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + x30, we\\n30\\nwrite \\nx\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\n, which is read as ‘the sum of xi as i varies from 1 to 30’.\\n30\\nx\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\nSo,\\nx =\\n30\\nn\\nx\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\nSimilarly, for n observations\\nx =\\nn\\nExample 11 : Find the mean of the marks obtained by 30 students of Class IX of a\\nschool, given in Example 2.\\nx\\nx\\nx\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n\\x01\\n1\\n2\\n30\\nSolution : Now,\\nx  =\\n30\\n30\\nx\\n \\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\n = 10 + 20 + 36 + 92 + 95 + 40 + 50 + 56 + 60 + 70 + 92 + 88\\n80 + 70 + 72 + 70 + 36 + 40 + 36 + 40 + 92 + 40 + 50 + 50\\n56 + 60 + 70 + 60 + 60 + 88 = 1779\\nSo,\\nx  = 1779\\n30  = 59.3\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c264\\nMATHEMATICS\\nIs the process not time consuming? Can we simplify it? Note that we have formed\\na frequency table for this data (see Table 14.1).\\nThe table shows that 1 student obtained 10 marks, 1 student obtained 20 marks, 3\\nstudents obtained 36 marks, 4 students obtained 40 marks, 3 students obtained 50\\nmarks, 2 students obtained 56 marks, 4 students obtained 60 marks, 4 students obtained\\n70 marks, 1 student obtained 72 marks, 1 student obtained 80 marks, 2 students obtained\\n88 marks, 3 students obtained 92 marks and 1 student obtained 95 marks.\\nSo, the total marks obtained = (1 × 10) + (1 × 20) + (3 × 36) + (4 × 40) + (3 × 50)\\n+ (2 × 56) + (4 × 60) + (4 × 70) + (1 × 72) + (1 × 80)\\n+ (2 × 88) + (3 × 92) + (1 × 95)\\n= f1x1 + . . . + f13x13, where fi is the frequency of the ith\\nentry inTable 14.1.\\n13\\nf x\\nIn brief, we write this as \\ni\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\n.\\n13\\nf x\\nSo, the total marks obtained = \\ni\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\n= 10 + 20 + 108 + 160 + 150 + 112 + 240 + 280 + 72 + 80\\n+ 176 + 276 + 95\\n= 1779\\nNow, the total number of observations\\n13\\nf\\ni\\n=\\ni\\n1\\n=∑\\n=  f1 + f2 + . . . + f13\\n= 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1\\n= 30\\n13\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8f6\\nf x\\ni\\ni\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\n∑\\ni\\n=\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\nSo,\\nthe mean x  =\\nSum of all the observations\\n1\\n13\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\nTotal number of observations  = \\nf\\n∑\\ni\\ni\\n1\\n=\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\uf8f8\\n= 1779\\n30  = 59.3\\nThis process can be displayed in the following table, which is a modified form of\\nTable 14.1.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cSTATISTICS\\n265\\nTable 14.12\\nMarks\\nNumber of students\\nfixi\\n(xi)\\n( fi)\\n10\\n1\\n10\\n20\\n1\\n20\\n36\\n3\\n108\\n40\\n4\\n160\\n50\\n3\\n150\\n56\\n2\\n112\\n60\\n4\\n240\\n70\\n4\\n280\\n72\\n1\\n72\\n80\\n1\\n80\\n88\\n2\\n176\\n92\\n3\\n276\\n95\\n1\\n95\\n13\\n13\\n30\\ni\\ni\\nf\\n1779\\ni\\ni\\ni\\nf x\\n1\\n1\\n=\\n=\\n∑\\n=\\n=\\n∑\\nThus, in the case of an ungrouped frequency distribution, you can use the formula\\nn\\nf x\\ni\\ni\\n∑\\n1\\n=\\nx  =\\ni\\nn\\nf\\ni\\n∑\\ni\\n1\\n=\\nfor calculating the mean.\\nLet us now move back to the situation of the argument between Hari and Mary,\\nand consider the second case where Hari found his performance better by finding the\\nmiddle-most score.

Using the knowledge of mode, these industries decide which size of\\nthe product should be produced in large numbers.\\nLet us illustrate this with the help of an example.\\nExample 14 : Find the mode of the following marks (out of 10) obtained by 20\\nstudents:\\n4, 6, 5, 9, 3, 2, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 9, 10, 10, 3, 4, 7, 6, 9, 9\\nSolution : We arrange this data in the following form :\\n2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10\\nHere 9 occurs most frequently, i.e., four times. So, the mode is 9.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c268\\nMATHEMATICS\\nExample 15 : Consider a small unit of a factory where there are 5 employees : a\\nsupervisor and four labourers. The labourers draw a salary of ` 5,000 per month each\\nwhile the supervisor gets ` 15,000 per month. Calculate the mean, median and mode\\nof the salaries of this unit of the factory.\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n = 35000\\nSolution : Mean = 5000\\n5000\\n5000\\n5000\\n15000\\n5\\n5\\n = 7000\\nSo, the mean salary is ` 7000 per month.\\nTo obtain the median, we arrange the salaries in ascending order:\\n5000,\\n5000,\\n5000,\\n5000,\\n15000\\nSince the number of employees in the factory is 5, the median is given by the\\n5\\n1\\n2\\n6\\n2\\n+\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\uf8f7\\n=\\nth\\nth = 3rd observation. Therefore, the median is ` 5000 per month.\\nTo find the mode of the salaries, i.e., the modal salary, we see that 5000 occurs the\\nmaximum number of times in the data 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 15000. So, the modal\\nsalary is ` 5000 per month.\\nNow compare the three measures of central tendency for the given data in the\\nexample above. You can see that the mean salary of ` 7000 does not give even an\\napproximate estimate of any one of their wages, while the medial and modal salaries\\nof ` 5000 represents the data more effectively.\\nExtreme values in the data affect the mean. This is one of the weaknesses of the\\nmean. So, if the data has a few points which are very far from most of the other\\npoints, (like 1,7,8,9,9) then the mean is not a good representative of this data. Since the\\nmedian and mode are not affected by extreme values present in the data, they give a\\nbetter estimate of the average in such a situation.\\nAgain let us go back to the situation of Hari and Mary, and compare the three\\nmeasures of central tendency.\\nMeasures\\nHari\\nMary\\nof central tendency\\nMean\\n8.2\\n8.4\\nMedian\\n10\\n8\\nMode\\n10\\n8',\n",

For example, in (1), ‘probably\\nrain’ will mean it may rain or may not rain today. We are predicting rain today based\\non our past experience when it rained under similar conditions. Similar predictions are\\nalso made in other cases listed in (2) to (5).\\nThe uncertainty of ‘probably’ etc can be measured numerically by means of\\n‘probability’ in many cases.\\nThough probability started with gambling, it has been used extensively in the fields\\nof Physical Sciences, Commerce, Biological Sciences, Medical Sciences, Weather\\nForecasting, etc.\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c272\\nMATHEMATICS\\n15.2 Probability – an Experimental Approach\\nIn earlier classes, you have had a glimpse of probability when you performed\\nexperiments like tossing of coins, throwing of dice, etc., and observed their outcomes.\\nYou will now learn to measure the chance of occurrence of a particular outcome in an\\nexperiment.\\nThe concept of probability developed in a very\\nstrange manner. In 1654, a gambler Chevalier\\nde Mere, approached the well-known 17th\\ncentury French philosopher and mathematician\\nBlaise Pascal regarding certain dice problems.\\nPascal became interested in these problems,\\nstudied them and discussed them with another\\nFrench mathematician, Pierre de Fermat. Both\\nPascal and Fermat solved the problems\\nindependently. This work was the beginning\\nof Probability Theory.\\nBlaise Pascal\\n(1623–1662)\\nFig. 15.1\\nPierre de Fermat\\n(1601–1665)\\nFig. 15.2\\nThe first book on the subject was written by the Italian mathematician, J.Cardan\\n(1501–1576). The title of the book was ‘Book on Games of Chance’ (Liber de Ludo\\nAleae), published in 1663. Notable contributions were also made by mathematicians\\nJ. Bernoulli (1654–1705), P. Laplace (1749–1827), A.A. Markov (1856–1922) and A.N.\\nKolmogorov (born 1903).\\nActivity 1 : (i) Take any coin, toss it ten times and note down the number of times a\\nhead and a tail come up. Record your observations in the form of the following table\\nTable 15.1\\nNumber of times\\nNumber of times\\nNumber of times\\nthe coin is tossed\\nhead comes up\\ntail comes up\\n10\\n—\\n—\\nWrite down the values of the following fractions:\\nNumber of times a head comes up\\nTotal number of times the coin is tossed\\nNumber of times a tail comes up\\nand\\nTotal number of times the coin is tossed\\n2022-23\\n\\x0cPROBABILLITY\\n273\\n(ii) Toss the coin twenty times and in the same way record your observations as\\nabove. Again find the values of the fractions given above for this collection of\\nobservations.\\n(iii) Repeat the same experiment by increasing the number of tosses and record\\nthe number of heads and tails. Then find the values of the corresponding\\nfractions.\\nYou will find that as the number of tosses gets larger, the values of the fractions\\ncome closer to 0.5. To record what happens in more and more tosses, the following\\ngroup activity can also be performed:\\nAcitivity 2 : Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3 students. Let a student in each\\ngroup toss a coin 15 times. Another student in each group should record the observations\\nregarding heads and tails. [Note that coins of the same denomination should be used in\\nall the groups. It will be treated as if only one coin has been tossed by all the groups.]\\nNow, on the blackboard, make a table like Table 15.2. First, Group 1 can write\\ndown its observations and calculate the resulting fractions. Then Group 2 can write\\ndown its observations, but will calculate the fractions for the combined data of Groups\\n1 and 2, and so on. (We may call these fractions as cumulative fractions.) We have\\nnoted the first three rows based on the observations given by one class of students.\\nTable 15.2\\nGroup\\nNumber\\nNumber\\nCumulative number of heads Cumulative number of tails\\nof\\nof\\nTotal number of times\\nTotal number of times\\nheads\\ntails\\nthe coin is tossed\\nthe coin is tossed\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n3\\n1\\n3\\n12\\n15\\n12\\n15\\n7\\n3\\n10\\n8\\n12\\n20\\n2\\n7\\n8\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n15\\n15\\n30\\n15\\n15\\n30\\n7\\n10\\n17\\n8\\n20\\n28\\n3\\n7\\n8\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n15\\n30\\n45\\n15\\n30\\n45\\n4\\n\\x01\\n\\x01\\n\\x01\\n\\x01\\nWhat do you observe in the table?

Divide the\\nstudents in your class, into small groups. One student in each group should throw a die\\nten times. Observations should be noted and cumulative fractions should be calculated.\\nThe values of the fractions for the number 1 can be recorded in Table 15.4.

You will find that the more\\nthe number of tosses, the closer are the values of A, B and C to 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25,\\nrespectively.\\nIn Activity 1, each toss of a coin is called a trial. Similarly in Activity 3, each\\nthrow of a die is a trial, and each simultaneous toss of two coins in Activity 4 is also a\\ntrial.\\nSo, a trial is an action which results in one or several outcomes. The possible\\noutcomes in Activity 1 were Head and Tail; whereas in Activity 3, the possible outcomes\\nwere 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\\nIn Activity 1, the getting of a head in a particular throw is an event with outcome\\n‘head’. Similarly, getting a tail is an event with outcome ‘tail’. In Activity 2, the\\ngetting of a particular number, say 1, is an event with outcome 1.\\nIf our experiment was to throw the die for getting an even number, then the event\\nwould consist of three outcomes, namely, 2, 4 and 6.\\nSo, an event for an experiment is the collection of some outcomes of the experiment.\\nIn Class X, you will study a more formal definition of an event.\\nSo, can you now tell what the events are in Activity 4?\\nWith this background, let us now see what probability is. Based on what we directly\\nobserve as the outcomes of our trials, we find the experimental or empirical probability.\\nLet n be the total number of trials. The empirical probability P(E) of an event E\\nhappening, is given by\\nP(E) = Number of trials in which the event happened\\nThe total number of trials\\nIn this chapter, we shall be finding the empirical probability, though we will write\\n‘probability’ for convenience.\\nLet us consider some examples.\\nTo start with let us go back to Activity 2, and Table 15.2. In Column (4) of this\\ntable, what is the fraction that you calculated? Nothing, but it is the empirical probability\\nof getting a head. Note that this probability kept changing depending on the number of\\ntrials and the number of heads obtained in these trials. Similarly, the empirical probability\\nof getting a tail is obtained in Column (5) of Table 15.2. This is 12\\n15  to start with, then\\nit is 2\\n3 , then 28',\n",

Let us\\ncall the events of getting a head and of getting a tail as E and F, respectively.

This principle marks a departure\\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\\na gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also\\nattempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\\ndifferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in\\nthe direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the national Policy on\\nEducation (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\\nactivities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children\\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not\\nas receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThis aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.\\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather then a\\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities\\nrequiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.\\nWe wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,\\nProfessor J.V.

This is possible, by using measures of central tendency or averages.\\nConsider a situation when two students Mary and Hari received their test copies.\\nThe test had five questions, each carrying ten marks. Their scores were as follows:\\nQuestion Numbers\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nMary’s score\\n10\\n8\\n9\\n8\\n7\\nHari’s score\\n4\\n7\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n2022-23\\n\\x0c262\\nMATHEMATICS\\nUpon getting the test copies, both of them found their average scores as follows:\\nMary’s average score = 42\\n5  = 8.4\\nHari’s average score = 41\\n5  = 8.2\\nSince Mary’s average score was more than Hari’s, Mary claimed to have performed\\nbetter than Hari, but Hari did not agree. He arranged both their scores in ascending\\norder and found out the middle score as given below:\\nMary’s Score\\n7\\n8\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nHari’s Score\\n4\\n7\\n10\\n10\\n10\\n Hari said that since his middle-most score was 10, which was higher than Mary’s\\nmiddle-most score, \n",
    "that is 8, his performance should be rated better.\\nBut Mary was not convinced. To convince Mary, Hari tried out another strategy.\\nHe said he had scored 10 marks more often (3 times) as compared to Mary who\\nscored 10 marks only once.
